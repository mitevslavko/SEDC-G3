        <h2><b>Combustion chambers</b></h2>
        <p>A combustion chamber is part of an internal combustion engine in which the fuel/air mix is burned. <br/>For steam engines, the term has also been used for an extension of the firebox which is used to allow a more complete combustion process.</p>
        <p>Different type of vehicles have different setup of their components. Here are some of them.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Car engines</b></dt>
            <dd>Most car engines have four to eight cylinders, with some high-performance cars having ten, 12 — or even 16, and some very small cars and trucks having two or three.<br/> In previous years, some quite large cars such as the DKW and Saab 92, had two-cylinder or two-stroke engines.</dd>

            <dt><b>Radial aircraft engines.</b></dt>
            <dd>Radial aircraft engines had from three to 28 cylinders; examples include the small Kinner B-5 and the large Pratt & Whitney R-4360. Larger examples were built as multiple rows. <br/> As each row contains an odd number of cylinders, to give an even firing sequence for a four-stroke engine, an even number indicates a two- or four-row engine. The largest of these was the Lycoming R-7755 with 36 cylinders (four rows of nine cylinders), but it did not enter production.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Motorcycles</b></dt>
            <dd>Motorcycles commonly have from one to four cylinders, with a few high-performance models having six; although, some 'novelties' exist with 8, 10, or 12.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Snowmobiles</b></dt>
            <dd>Snowmobiles Usually have one to four cylinders and can be both 2-stroke or 4-stroke, normally in the in-line configuration; however, there are again some novelties that exist with V-4 engines</dd>
