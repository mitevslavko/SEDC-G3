<span class="subhead">THE BIRTH OF THE SCIENCE OF ELECTRICITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Although</span> the science of electricity is of comparatively
recent date, electricity itself has existed from the beginning
of the world. There can be no doubt that man’s introduction
to electricity was brought about through the
medium of the thunderstorm, and from very early times
come down to us records of the terror inspired by thunder
and lightning, and of the ways in which the ancients tried
to account for the phenomena. Even to-day, although we
know what lightning is and how it is produced, a severe
thunderstorm fills us with a certain amount of awe, if not
fear; and we can understand what a terrifying experience
it must have been to the ancients, who had none of our
knowledge.</p>

<p>These early people had simple minds, and from our
point of view they had little intelligence; but they possessed
a great deal of curiosity. They were just as anxious to
explain things as we are, and so they were not content
until they had invented an explanation of lightning and
thunder. Their favourite way of accounting for anything
they did not understand was to make up a sort of romance
about it. They believed that the heavens were inhabited
by various gods, who showed their pleasure or anger by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
signs, and so they naturally concluded that thunder was
the voice of angry gods, and lightning the weapon with
which they struck down those who had displeased them.
Prayers and sacrifices were therefore offered to the gods, in
the hope of appeasing their wrath.</p>

<p>Greek and Roman mythology contains many references
to thunder and lightning. For instance, we read about
the great god Zeus, who wielded thunder-bolts which had
been forged in underground furnaces by the giant Cyclops.
There was no doubt that the thunder-bolts were made in
this way, because one only had to visit a volcano in order
to see the smoke from the furnace, and hear the rumbling
echo of the far-off hammering. Then we are told the
tragic story of Phaeton, son of the Sun-god. This youth,
like many others since his time, was daring and venturesome,
and imagined that he could do things quite as well
as his father. On one occasion he tried to drive his father’s
chariot, and, as might have been expected, it got beyond
his control, and came dangerously near the Earth. The
land was scorched, the oceans were dried up, and the whole
Earth was threatened with utter destruction. In order to
prevent such a frightful catastrophe, Jupiter, the mighty
lord of the heavens, hurled a thunder-bolt at Phaeton, and
struck him from the chariot into the river Po. A whole
book could be written about these ancient legends concerning
the thunderstorm, but, interesting as they are, they
have no scientific value, and many centuries were to elapse
before the real nature of lightning was understood.</p>

<p>In order to trace the first glimmerings of electrical
knowledge we must leave the thunderstorm and pass on to
more trivial matters. On certain sea-coasts the ancients
found a transparent yellow substance capable of taking a
high polish, and much to be desired as an ornament; and
about 600 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it was discovered that this substance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
when rubbed, gained the power of drawing to it bits of
straw, feathers, and other light bodies. This discovery is
generally credited to a Greek philosopher named Thales,
941–563 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and it must be regarded as the first step
towards the foundation of electrical science. The yellow
substance was amber. We now know it to be simply a
sort of fossilized resin, but the Greeks gave it a much more
romantic origin. When Phaeton’s rashness brought him
to an untimely end, his sorrowing sisters, the Heliades,
were changed into poplar trees, and their tears into amber.
Amongst the names given to the Sun-god was Alector,
which means the shining one, and so the tears of the
Heliades came to have the name Electron, or the shining
thing. Unlike most of the old legends, this story of the
fate of the Sun-maidens is of great importance to us, for
from the word “electron” we get the name Electricity.</p>

<p>Thales and his contemporaries seem to have made no
serious attempts to explain the attraction of the rubbed
amber, and indeed so little importance was attached to the
discovery that it was completely forgotten. About 321 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
one Theophrastus found that a certain mineral called
“lyncurium” gained attractive powers when rubbed, but
again little attention was paid to the matter, and astonishing
as it may seem, no further progress worth mention was
made until towards the close of the sixteenth century, when
Doctor Gilbert of Colchester began to experiment seriously.
This man was born about 1543, and took his degree of
doctor of medicine at Cambridge in 1569. He was very
successful in his medical work, and became President of the
College of Physicians, and later on physician to Queen
Elizabeth. He had a true instinct for scientific research,
and was not content to accept statements on the authority
of others, but tested everything for himself. He found
that sulphur, resin, sealing-wax, and many other substances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
behaved like amber when rubbed, but he failed to get any
results from certain other substances, such as the metals.
He therefore called the former substances “electrics,” and
the latter “anelectrics,” or non-electrics. His researches
were continued by other investigators, and from him dates
the science of electricity.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Suspended
pith ball for showing electric attraction.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Leaving historical matters for the present, we will
examine the curious power which is gained by substances
as the result of rubbing. Amber is not always obtainable,
and so we will use in its place a glass
rod and a stick of sealing-wax. If the
glass rod is rubbed briskly with a dry
silk handkerchief, and then held close
to a number of very small bits of paper,
the bits are immediately drawn to the
rod, and the same thing occurs if the
stick of sealing-wax is substituted for
the glass. This power of attraction is
due to the presence of a small charge
of electricity on the rubbed glass and
sealing-wax, or in other words, the two
substances are said to be electrified.
Bits of paper are unsatisfactory for careful
experimenting, and instead of them
we will use the simple piece of apparatus shown in <a href="#fig_1" class="pginternal">Fig. 1</a>.
This consists of a ball of elder pith, suspended from a glass
support by means of a silk thread. If now we repeat our
experiments with the electrified glass or sealing-wax we
find that the little ball is attracted in the same way as the
bits of paper. But if we look carefully we shall notice that
attraction is not the only effect, for as soon as the ball
touches the electrified body it is driven away or repelled.
Now let us suspend, by means of a thread, a glass rod
which has been electrified by rubbing it with silk, and bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
near it in turn another silk-rubbed glass rod and a stick of
sealing-wax rubbed with flannel. The two glass rods are
found to repel one another, whereas the sealing-wax attracts
the glass. If the experiment is repeated with a suspended
stick of sealing-wax rubbed with flannel, the glass and the
sealing-wax attract each other, but the two sticks of wax
repel one another. Both glass and sealing-wax are
electrified, as may be seen by bringing them near the pith
ball, but there must be some difference between them as
we get attraction in one case and repulsion in the other.</p>

<p>The explanation is that the electric charges on the silk-rubbed
glass and on the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax are of
different kinds, the former being called positive, and the
latter negative. Bodies with similar charges, such as the
two glass rods, repel one another; while bodies with unlike
charges, such as the glass and the sealing-wax, attract each
other. We can now see why the pith ball was first
attracted and then repelled. To start with, the ball was
not electrified, and was attracted when the rubbed glass or
sealing-wax was brought near it. When however the
ball touched the electrified body it received a share of the
latter’s electricity, and as similar charges repel one another,
the ball was driven away.</p>

<p>The kind of electricity produced depends not only on
the substance rubbed, but also on the material used as the
rubber. For instance, we can give glass a negative charge
by rubbing it with flannel, and sealing-wax becomes
positively charged when rubbed with silk. The important
point to remember is that there are only two kinds of
electricity, and that every substance electrified by rubbing
is charged either positively, like the silk-rubbed glass, or
negatively, like the flannel-rubbed sealing-wax.</p>

<p>If we try to electrify a metal rod by holding it in the
hand and rubbing it, we get no result, but if we fasten to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the metal a handle of glass, and hold it by this while
rubbing, we find that it becomes electrified in the same way
as the glass rod or the sealing-wax. Substances such as
glass do not allow electricity to pass along them, so that in
rubbing a glass rod the part rubbed becomes charged, and
the electricity stays there, being unable to spread to the
other parts of the rod. Substances such as metals allow
electricity to pass easily, so that when a metal rod is
rubbed electricity is produced, but it immediately spreads
over the whole rod, reaches the hand, and escapes. If we
wish the metal to retain its charge we must provide it with
a handle of glass or of some other material which does not
allow electricity to pass. Dr. Gilbert did not know this,
and so he came to the conclusion that metals were non-electrics,
or could not be electrified.</p>

<p>Substances which allow electricity to pass freely are
called conductors, and those which do not are called non-conductors;
while between the two extremes are many
substances which are called partial conductors. It may be
said here that no substance is quite perfect in either respect,
for all conductors offer some resistance to the passage of
electricity, while all non-conductors possess some conducting
power. Amongst conductors are metals, acids, water,
and the human body; cotton, linen, and paper are partial
conductors; and air, resin, silk, glass, sealing-wax, and
gutta-percha are non-conductors. When a conductor is
guarded by a non-conductor so that its electricity cannot
escape, it is said to be insulated, from Latin, <i lang="la">insula</i>, an
island; and non-conductors are also called “insulators.”</p>

<p>So far we have mentioned only the electric charge
produced on the substance rubbed, but the material used as
rubber also becomes electrified. The two charges, however,
are not alike, but one is always positive and the other
negative. For instance, if glass is rubbed with silk, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
glass receives a positive, and the silk a negative charge.
It also can be shown that the two opposite charges are
always equal in quantity.</p>

<p>The two kinds of electricity are generally represented
by the signs + and -, the former standing for positive
and the latter for negative electricity.</p>

<p>The electricity produced by rubbing, or friction, is
known as Static Electricity; that is, electricity in a state of
rest, as distinguished from electricity in motion, or current
electricity. The word static is derived from a Greek word
meaning to stand. At the same time it must be understood
that this electricity of friction is at rest only in the
sense that it is a prisoner, unable to move. When we
produce a charge of static electricity on a glass rod, by
rubbing it, the electricity would escape fast enough if it
could. It has only two possible ways of escape, along the
rod and through the air, and as both glass and air are non-conductors
it is obliged to remain at rest where it was
produced. On the other hand, as we have seen, the
electricity produced by rubbing a metal rod which is not
protected by an insulating handle escapes instantly, because
the metal is a good conductor.</p>

<p>When static electricity collects in sufficient quantities
it discharges itself in the form of a bright spark, and we
shall speak of these sparks in <a href="#chapter_III" class="pginternal">Chapter III</a>. Static electricity
is of no use for doing useful work, such as ringing bells or
driving motors, and in fact, except for scientific purposes,
it is more of a nuisance than a help. It collects almost
everywhere, and its power of attraction makes it very
troublesome at times. In the processes of textile manufacture
static electricity is produced in considerable
quantities, and it makes its presence known by causing the
threads to stick together in the most annoying fashion. In
printing rooms too it plays pranks, making the sheets of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
paper stick together so that the printing presses have to be
stopped.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, static electricity has been detected in
the act of interfering with the work of its twin brother,
current electricity. A little while ago it was noticed that
the electric incandescent lamps in a certain building were
lasting only a very short time, the filaments being found
broken after comparatively little use. Investigations
showed that the boy was in the habit of dusting the lamp
globes with a feather duster. The friction set up in this
way produced charges of electricity on the glass, and this
had the effect of breaking the filaments. When this
method of dusting was discontinued the trouble ceased, and
the lamps lasted their proper number of hours.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND THE LEYDEN JAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> amount of electricity produced by the rubbing of glass
or sealing-wax rods is very small, and experimenters soon
felt the need of apparatus to produce larger quantities. In
1675 the first electrical machine was made by Otto von
Guericke, the inventor of the air-pump. His machine consisted
of a globe of sulphur fixed on a spindle, and rotated
while the hands were pressed against it to provide the
necessary friction. Globes and cylinders of glass soon
replaced the sulphur globe, and the friction was produced
by cushions instead of by the hands. Still later, revolving
plates of glass were employed. These machines worked
well enough in a dry atmosphere, but were very troublesome
in wet weather, and they are now almost entirely
superseded by what are known as <em>influence</em> machines.</p>

<p>In order to understand the working of influence
machines, it is necessary to have a clear idea of what is
meant by the word influence as used in an electrical sense.
In the previous chapter we saw that a pith ball was
attracted by an electrified body, and that when the ball
touched that body it received a charge of electricity.
We now have to learn that one body can receive a charge
from another body without actual contact, by what is called
“influence,” or electro-static induction. In <a href="#fig_2" class="pginternal">Fig. 2</a> is seen a
simple arrangement for showing this influence or induction.
A is a glass ball, and BC a piece of metal, either solid or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
hollow, made somewhat in the shape of a sausage, and
insulated by means of its glass support. Three pairs of
pith balls are suspended from BC as shown. If A is
electrified positively, and brought near BC, the pith balls
at B and C repel one another, showing that the ends of
BC are electrified. No repulsion takes place between the
two pith balls at the middle, indicating that this part of
BC is not electrified. If the charges at B and C are tested
they are found to be of opposite kinds, that at B being
negative, and that at C positive. Thus it appears that
the positive charge on A has attracted a negative charge
to B, and repelled a positive one to C. If A is taken
away, the two opposite charges on BC unite and neutralise
one another, and BC is left in its original uncharged condition,
while A is found to have lost none of its own charge.
If BC is made in two parts, and if these are separated while
under the influence of A, the two charges cannot unite
when A is removed, but remain each on its own half of
BC. In this experiment A is said to have induced electrification
on BC. Induction will take place across a considerable
distance, and it is not stopped by the interposition
of obstacles such as a sheet of glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>We can now understand why an electrified body
attracts an unelectrified body, as in our pith ball experiments.
If we bring a positively charged glass rod near
a pith ball, the latter becomes electrified by induction, the
side nearer the rod receiving a negative, and the farther
side a positive charge. One half of the ball is therefore
attracted and the other half repelled, but as the attracted
half is the nearer, the attraction is stronger than the repulsion,
and so the ball moves towards the rod.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>—The Electrophorus.
</figcaption></figure>

<p><a href="#fig_3" class="pginternal">Fig. 3</a> shows an appliance for obtaining strong charges
of electricity by influence or induction. It is called the
<em>electrophorus</em>, the name coming from two Greek words,
<em>electron</em>, amber, and <em>phero</em>,
I yield or bear; and it was
devised in 1775 by Volta, an
Italian professor of physics.
The apparatus consists of a
round cake, A, of some
resinous material contained
in a metal dish, and a round
disc of metal, B, of slightly
smaller diameter, fitted with
an insulating handle. A simple electrophorus may be
made by filling with melted sealing-wax the lid of a
round tin, the disc being made of a circular piece of
copper or brass, a little smaller than the lid, fastened to
the end of a stick of sealing-wax. To use the electrophorus,
the sealing-wax is electrified negatively by rubbing
it with flannel. The metal disc is then placed on the
sealing-wax, touched for an instant with the finger, and
lifted away. The disc is now found to be electrified
positively, and it may be discharged and the process repeated
many times without recharging the sealing-wax.
The charge on the latter is not used up in the process,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
but it gradually leaks away, and after a time it has to
be renewed.</p>

<p>The theory of the electrophorus is easy to understand
from what we have already learnt about influence. When
the disc B is placed on the charged cake A, the two surfaces
are really in contact at only three or four points,
because neither of them is a true plane; so that on the
whole the disc and the cake are like A and BC in <a href="#fig_2" class="pginternal">Fig. 2</a>,
only much closer together. The negative charge on
A acts by induction
on the disc B, attracting
a positive charge
to the under side, and
repelling a negative
charge to the upper
side. When the disc
is touched, the negative
charge on the
upper side escapes, but
the positive charge
remains, being as it
were held fast by the
attraction of the negative
charge on A. If
the disc is now raised, the positive charge is no longer
bound on the under side, and it therefore spreads over
both surfaces, remaining there because its escape is cut
off by the insulating handle.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—Wimshurst Machine.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>We may now try to understand the working of influence
machines, which are really mechanically worked electrophori.
There are various types of such machines, but the
one in most general use in this country is that known as
the Wimshurst machine, <a href="#fig_4" class="pginternal">Fig. 4</a>, and we will therefore
confine ourselves to this. It consists of two circular plates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of varnished glass or of ebonite, placed close together and
so geared that they rotate in opposite directions. On the
outer surfaces of the plates are cemented sectors of metal
foil, at equal distances apart. Each plate has the same
number of sectors, so that at any given moment the sectors
on one plate are exactly opposite those on the other.
Across the outer surface of each plate is fixed a rod of
metal carrying at its ends light tinsel brushes, which are
adjusted to touch the sectors as they pass when the plates
are rotated. These rods are placed at an angle to each
other of from sixty to ninety degrees, and the brushes are
called neutralizing brushes. The machine is now complete
for generating purposes, but in order to collect the electricity
two pairs of insulated metal combs are provided, one pair
at each end of the horizontal diameter, with the teeth
pointing inward towards the plates, but not touching them.
The collecting combs are fitted with adjustable discharging
rods terminating in round knobs.</p>

<p>The principle upon which the machine works will be
best understood by reference to <a href="#fig_5" class="pginternal">Fig. 5</a>. In this diagram
the inner circle represents the front plate, with neutralizing
brushes A and B, and the outer one represents the back
plate, with brushes C and D. The sectors are shown
heavily shaded. E and F are the pairs of combs, and the
plates rotate in the direction of the arrows. Let us suppose
one of the sectors at the top of the back plate to have a
slight positive charge. As the plates rotate this sector will
come opposite to a front plate sector touched by brush A,
and it will induce a slight negative charge on the latter
sector, at the same time repelling a positive charge along
the rod to the sector touched by brush B. The two sectors
carrying the induced charges now move on until opposite
back plate sectors touched by brushes C and D, and these
back sectors will receive by induction positive and negative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
charges respectively. This process continues as the plates
rotate, and finally all the sectors moving towards comb E
will be positively charged, while those approaching comb
F will be negatively charged. The combs collect these
charges, and the discharging rods K and L become highly
electrified, K positively and L negatively, and if they are
near enough together sparks will pass between them.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;" id="fig_5">
  <img alt=" " height="1762" src="images/i_024.jpg" width="2086" id="id-2533041077759476490">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>—Diagram to illustrate working of a Wimshurst Machine.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the commencement we supposed one of the sectors
to have a positive charge, but it is not necessary to charge
a sector specially, for the machine is self-starting. Why
this is the case is not yet thoroughly understood, but probably
the explanation is that at any particular moment no
two places in the atmosphere are in exactly the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
electro-static condition, so that an uneven state of charge
exists permanently amongst the sectors.</p>

<p>The Wimshurst machine provides us with a plentiful
supply of electricity, and the question naturally arises,
“Can this electricity be stored up in any way?” In 1745,
long before the days of influence machines, a certain Bishop
of Pomerania, Von Kleist by name, got the idea that if he
could persuade a charge of electricity to go into a glass
bottle he would be able to capture it, because glass was a
non-conductor. So he partly filled a bottle with water, led
a wire down into the water, and while holding the bottle in
one hand connected the wire to a primitive form of electric
machine. When he thought he had got enough electricity
he tried to remove his bottle in order to examine the contents,
and in so doing he received a shock which scared
him considerably. He had succeeded in storing electricity
in his bottle. Shortly afterwards the bishop’s experiment
was repeated by Professor Muschenbrock of Leyden, and
by his pupil Cuneus, the former being so startled by the
shock that he wrote, “I would not take a second shock for
the kingdom of France.” But in spite of shocks the end
was achieved; it was proved that electricity could be collected
and stored up, and the bottle became known as the
Leyden jar. The original idea was soon improved upon,
water being replaced by a coating of tinfoil, and it was
found that better results were obtained by coating the
outside of the bottle as well as the inside.</p>

<p>As now used the Leyden jar consists of a glass jar
covered inside and outside with tinfoil up to about two-thirds
of its height. A wooden lid is fitted, through which passes
a brass rod terminating above in a brass knob, and below
in a piece of brass chain long enough to touch the foil
lining. A Leyden jar is charged by holding it in one
hand with its knob presented to the discharging ball of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Wimshurst machine, and even if the machine is small and
feeble the jar will accumulate electricity until it is very
highly charged. It may now be put down on the table,
and if it is clean and quite dry it will hold its charge for
some time. If the outer and inner coatings of the jar are
connected by means of a piece of metal, the electricity will
be discharged in the form of a bright spark. A Leyden
jar is usually discharged by means of discharging tongs,
consisting of a jointed brass rod with brass terminal
knobs and glass handles. One knob is placed in contact
with the outer coating of foil, and the other brought near
to the knob of the jar, which of course is connected with
the inner coating.</p>

<p>The electrical capacity of even a small Leyden jar is
surprisingly great, and this is due to the mutual attraction
between opposite kinds of electricity. If we stick a piece
of tinfoil on the centre of each face of a pane of glass, and
charge one positively and the other negatively, the two
charges attract each other through the glass; and in fact
they hold on to each other so strongly that we can get very
little electricity by touching either piece of foil. This
mutual attraction enables us to charge the two pieces of
foil much more strongly than if they were each on a
separate pane, and this is the secret of the working of the
Leyden jar. If the knob of the jar is held to the positive
ball of a Wimshurst, the inside coating receives a positive
charge, which acts inductively on the outside coating,
attracting a negative charge to the inner face of the latter,
and repelling a positive charge to its outer face, and thence
away through the hand. The electricity is entirely confined
to the sides of the jar, the interior having no charge
whatever.</p>

<p>Leyden jars are very often fitted to a Wimshurst
machine as shown at A, A, <a href="#fig_4" class="pginternal">Fig. 4</a>, and arranged so that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
can be connected or disconnected to the collecting combs
as desired. When the jars are disconnected the machine
gives a rapid succession of thin sparks, but when the jars
are connected to the combs they accumulate a number of
charges before the discharge takes place, with the result
that the sparks are thicker, but occur at less frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that the rod of a Leyden jar
and the discharging rods of a Wimshurst machine are
made to terminate not in points, but in rounded knobs or
balls. The reason of this is that electricity rapidly leaks
away from points. If we electrify a conductor shaped like
a cone with a sharp point, the density of the electricity is
greatest at that point, and when it becomes sufficiently
great the particles of air near the point become electrified
and repelled. Other particles take their place, and are
electrified and repelled in the same way, and so a constant
loss of electricity takes place. This may be shown in an
interesting way by fastening with wax a needle to the knob
of a Wimshurst. If a lighted taper is held to the point of
the needle while the machine is in action, the flame is
blown aside by the streams of repelled air, which form a
sort of electric wind.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRICITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> the Leyden jars of a Wimshurst machine are connected
up and the discharging balls placed at a suitable distance
apart, the electricity produced by rotating the plates is
discharged in the form of a brilliant zigzag spark between
the balls, accompanied by a sharp crack. The resemblance
between this spark and forked lightning is at once evident,
and in fact it is lightning in miniature. The discharging
balls are charged, as we have seen, with opposite kinds of
electricity, and these charges are constantly trying to reach
one another across the intervening air, which, being an
insulator, vigorously opposes their passage. There is thus
a kind of struggle going on between the air and the two
charges of electricity, and this keeps the air in a state of
constant strain. But the resisting power of the air is
limited, and when the charges reach a certain strength the
electricity violently forces its way across, literally rupturing
or splitting the air. The particles of air along the path of
the discharge are rendered incandescent by the heat produced
by the passage of the electricity, and so the brilliant
flash is produced. Just as a river winds about seeking the
easiest course, so the electricity takes the path of least
resistance, which probably is determined by the particles
of dust in the air, and also by the density of the air, which
becomes compressed in front, leaving less dense air and
therefore an easier path on each side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>The connexion between lightning and the sparks from
electrified bodies and electrical machines was suspected by
many early observers, but it remained for Benjamin
Franklin to prove that lightning was simply a tremendous
electric discharge, by actually obtaining electricity from a
thunder-cloud. Franklin was an American, born at Boston
in 1706. He was a remarkable man in every way, and
quite apart from his investigations in electricity, will always
be remembered for the great public services he rendered to
his country in general and to Philadelphia in particular.
He founded the Philadelphia Library, the American Philosophical
Society, and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Franklin noticed many similarities between electricity
and lightning. For instance, both produced zigzag sparks,
both were conducted by metals, both set fire to inflammable
materials, and both were capable of killing animals. These
resemblances appeared to him so striking that he was
convinced that the two were the same, and he resolved to
put the matter to the test. For this purpose he hit upon
the idea of using a kite, to the top of which was fixed a
pointed wire. At the lower end of the flying string was
tied a key, insulated by a piece of silk ribbon. In June
1752, Franklin flew his kite, and after waiting a while he
was rewarded by finding that when he brought his knuckle
near to the key a little spark made its appearance. This
spark was exactly like the sparks obtained from electrified
bodies, but to make things quite certain a Leyden jar was
charged from the key. Various experiments were then
performed with the jar, and it was proved beyond all doubt
that lightning and electricity were one and the same.</p>

<p>Lightning is then an enormous electric spark between a
cloud and the Earth, or between two clouds, produced when
opposite charges become so strong that they are able to
break down the intervening non-conducting layer of air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
The surface of the Earth is negatively electrified, the
electrification varying at different times and places; while
the electricity of the air is usually positive, but frequently
changes to negative in rainy weather and on other occasions.
As the clouds float about they collect the electricity from
the air, and thus they may be either positively or negatively
electrified, so that a discharge may take place between one
cloud and another, as well as between a cloud and the Earth.</p>

<p>Lightning flashes take different forms, the commonest
being forked or zigzag lightning, and sheet lightning.
The zigzag form is due to the discharge taking the easiest
path, as in the case of the spark from a Wimshurst machine.
Sheet lightning is probably the reflection of a flash taking
place at a distance. It may be unaccompanied by thunder,
as in the so-called “summer lightning,” seen on the horizon
at night, which is the reflection of a storm too far off for the
thunder to be heard. A much rarer form is globular or
ball lightning, in which the discharge takes the shape of a
ball of light, which moves slowly along and finally disappears
with a sudden explosion. The cause of this form
of lightning is not yet understood, but it is possible that the
ball of light consists of intensely heated and extremely
minute fragments of ordinary matter, torn off by the
violence of the lightning discharge. Another uncommon
form is multiple lightning, which consists of a number of
separate parallel discharges having the appearance of a
ribbon.</p>

<p>A lightning flash probably lasts from about 1/100,000 to
1/1,000,000 of a second, and in the majority of cases the
discharge is oscillatory; that is to say, it passes several times
backwards and forwards between two clouds or between a
cloud and the Earth. At times it appears as though we
could see the lightning start downwards from the cloud or
upwards from the Earth, but this is an optical illusion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
it is really quite impossible to tell at which end the flash
starts.</p>

<p>Death by lightning is instantaneous, and therefore
quite painless. We are apt to think that pain is felt at the
moment when a wound is inflicted. This is not the case
however, for no pain is felt until the impression reaches the
brain by way of the nerves, and this takes an appreciable
time. The nerves transmit sensations at a speed of only
about one hundred feet per second, so that in the case of a
man killed by a bullet through the brain, no pain would be
felt, because the brain would be deprived of sensibility
before the sensation could reach it. Lightning is infinitely
swifter than any bullet, so life would be destroyed by it
before any pain could be felt.</p>

<p>On one occasion Professor Tyndall, the famous
physicist, received accidentally a very severe shock from
a large battery of Leyden jars while giving a public lecture.
His account of his sensations is very interesting. “Life
was absolutely blotted out for a very sensible interval,
without a trace of pain. In a second or so consciousness
returned; I saw myself in the presence of the audience and
apparatus, and, by the help of these external appearances,
immediately concluded that I had received the battery discharge.
The intellectual consciousness of my position was
restored with exceeding rapidity, but not so the optical
consciousness. To prevent the audience from being
alarmed, I observed that it had often been my desire to
receive accidentally such a shock, and that my wish had at
length been fulfilled. But, while making this remark, the
appearance which my body presented to myself was that of
a number of separate pieces. The arms, for example, were
detached from the trunk, and seemed suspended in the air.
In fact, memory and the power of reasoning appeared to
be complete long before the optic nerve was restored to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
healthy action. But what I wish chiefly to dwell upon
here is, the absolute painlessness of the shock; and there
cannot be a doubt that, to a person struck dead by lightning,
the passage from life to death occurs without consciousness
being in the least degree implicated. It is an abrupt
stoppage of sensation, unaccompanied by a pang.”</p>

<p>Occasionally branched markings are found on the
bodies of those struck by lightning, and these are often
taken to be photographic impressions of trees under which
the persons may have been standing at the time of the
flash. The markings however are nothing of the kind,
but are merely physiological effects due to the passage of
the discharge.</p>

<p>During a thunderstorm it is safer to be in the house
than out in the open. It is probable that draughts are a
source of some danger, and the windows and doors of the
room ought to be shut. Animals are more liable to be
struck by lightning than men, and a shed containing
horses or cows is a dangerous place in which to take
shelter; in fact it is better to remain in the open. If one
is caught in a storm while out of reach of a house or other
building free from draughts and containing no animals,
the safest plan is to lie down, not minding the rain.
Umbrellas are distinctly dangerous, and never should be
used during a storm. Wire fences, hedges, and still or
running water should be given a wide berth, and it is
safer to be alone than in company with a crowd of people.
It is extremely foolish to take shelter under an isolated
tree, for such trees are very liable to be struck. Isolated
beech trees appear to have considerable immunity from
lightning, but any tree standing alone should be avoided,
the oak being particularly dangerous. On the other hand,
a fairly thick wood is comparatively safe, and failing a
house, should be chosen before all other places of refuge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Horses are liable to be struck, and if a storm comes on
while one is out driving it is safer to keep quite clear of the
animals.</p>

<p>When a Wimshurst machine has been in action for a
little time a peculiar odour is noticed. This is due to the
formation of a modified and chemically more active form of
oxygen, called <em>ozone</em>, the name being derived from the
Greek <em>ozein</em>, “to smell.” Ozone has very invigorating effects
when breathed, and it is also a powerful germicide, capable
of killing the germs which give rise to contagious diseases.
During a thunderstorm ozone is produced in large
quantities by the electric discharges, and thus the air
receives as it were a new lease of life, and we feel the
refreshing effects when the storm is over. We shall speak
again of ozone in <a href="#chapter_XXV" class="pginternal">Chapter XXV</a>.</p>

<p>Thunder probably is caused by the heating and sudden
expansion of the air in the path of the discharge, which
creates a partial vacuum into which the surrounding air
rushes violently. Light travels at the rate of 186,000
miles per second, and therefore the flash reaches us
practically instantaneously; but sound travels at the rate of
only about 1115 feet per second, so that the thunder takes
an appreciable time to reach us, and the farther away the
discharge the greater the interval between the flash and
the thunder. Thus by multiplying the number of seconds
which elapse between the flash and the thunder by 1115,
we may calculate roughly the distance in feet of the
discharge. A lightning flash may be several miles in
length, the greatest recorded length being about ten miles.
The sounds produced at different points along its path
reach us at different times, producing the familiar sharp
rattle, and the following rolling and rumbling is produced
by the echoes from other clouds. The noise of a thunder-clap
is so tremendous that it seems as though the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
would be heard far and wide, but the greatest distance at
which thunder has been heard is about fifteen miles. In
this respect it is interesting to compare the loudest
thunder-clap we ever heard with the noise of the famous
eruption of Krakatoa, in 1883, which was heard at the
enormous distance of nearly three thousand miles.</p>

<p>When Franklin had demonstrated the nature of
lightning, he began to consider the possibility of protecting
buildings from the disastrous effects of the lightning stroke.
At that time the amount of damage caused by lightning
was very great. Cathedrals, churches, public buildings,
and in fact all tall edifices were in danger every time a
severe thunderstorm took place in their neighbourhood, for
there was absolutely nothing to prevent their destruction if
the lightning chanced to strike them. Ships at sea, too,
were damaged very frequently by lightning, and often
some of the crew were killed or disabled. To-day, thanks
to the lightning conductor, it is an unusual occurrence for
ships or large buildings to be damaged by lightning. The
lightning strikes them as before, but in the great majority
of cases it is led away harmlessly to earth.</p>

<p>Franklin was the first to suggest the possibility of
protecting buildings by means of a rod of some conducting
material terminating in a point at the highest part of the
building, and leading down, outside the building, into the
earth. Lightning conductors at the present day are
similar to Franklin’s rod, but many improvements have
been made from time to time as our knowledge of the
nature and action of the lightning discharge has increased.
A modern lightning conductor generally consists of one or
more pointed rods fixed to the highest parts of the building,
and connected to a cable running directly to earth. This
cable is kept as straight as possible, because turns and
bends offer a very high resistance to the rapidly oscillating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
discharge; and it is connected to large copper plates
buried in permanently moist ground or in water, or to
water or gas mains. Copper is generally used for the
cable, but iron also may be employed. In any case, the
cable must be of sufficient thickness to prevent the
possibility of its being deflagrated by the discharge. In
ships the arrangements are similar, except that the cable is
connected to the copper sheathing of the bottom.</p>

<p>The fixing of lightning conductors must be carried out
with great care, for an improperly fixed conductor is not
only useless, but may be a source of actual danger.
Lightning flashes vary greatly in character, and while a
carefully erected lightning conductor is capable of dealing
with most of them, there are unfortunately certain kinds of
discharge with which it now and then is unable to deal.
The only absolutely certain way of protecting a building is
to surround it completely by a sort of cage of metal, but
except for buildings in which explosives are stored this
plan is usually impracticable.</p>

<p>The electricity of the atmosphere manifests itself in
other forms beside the lightning. The most remarkable
of these manifestations is the beautiful phenomenon known
in the Northern Hemisphere as the Aurora Borealis, and
in the Southern Hemisphere as the Aurora Australis.
Aurora means the morning hour or dawn, and the phenomenon
is so called from its resemblance to the dawn of
day. The aurora is seen in its full glory only in high
latitudes, and it is quite unknown at the equator. It
assumes various forms, sometimes appearing as an arch of
light with rapidly moving streamers of different colours,
and sometimes taking the form of a luminous curtain
extending across the sky. The light of the aurora is never
very strong, and as a rule stars can be seen through it.
Auroras are sometimes accompanied by rustling or crackling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
sounds, but the sounds are always extremely faint.
Some authorities assert that these sounds do not exist, and
that they are the result of imagination, but other equally
reliable observers have heard the sounds quite plainly on
several occasions. Probably the explanation of this confliction
of evidence is that the great majority of auroras are
silent, so that an observer might witness many of them
without hearing any sounds. The height at which auroras
occur is a disputed point, and one which it is difficult to
determine accurately; but most observers agree that it
is generally from 60 to 125 miles above the Earth’s
surface.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the aurora is caused by the
passage of electric discharges through the higher regions
of the atmosphere, where the air is so rarefied as to act as
a partial conductor; and its effects can be imitated in some
degree by passing powerful discharges through tubes from
which the air has been exhausted to a partial vacuum.
Auroral displays are usually accompanied by magnetic
disturbances, which sometimes completely upset telegraphic
communication. Auroras and magnetic storms appear to
be connected in some way with solar disturbances, for they
are frequently simultaneous with an unusual number of
sunspots, and all three run in cycles of about eleven and a
half years.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ELECTRIC CURRENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the previous chapters we have dealt with electricity in
charged bodies, or static electricity, and now we must turn
to electricity in motion, or current electricity. In <a href="#chapter_I" class="pginternal">Chapter I</a>.
we saw that if a metal rod is held in the hand and rubbed,
electricity is produced, but it immediately escapes along the
rod to the hand, and so to the earth. In other words, the
electricity flows away along the conducting path provided
by the rod and the hand. When we see the word “flow” we
at once think of a fluid of some kind, and we often hear
people speak of the “electric fluid.” Now, whatever
electricity may be it certainly is not a fluid, and we use
the word “flow” in connexion with electricity simply because
it is the most convenient word we can find for the purpose.
Just in the same way we might say that when we hold a
poker with its point in the fire, heat flows along it towards
our hand, although we know quite well that heat is not a
fluid. In the experiment with the metal rod referred to
above, the electricity flows away instantly, leaving the rod
unelectrified; but if we arrange matters so that the
electricity is renewed as fast as it flows away, then we get
a continuous flow, or current.</p>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1780 an Italian anatomist,
Luigi Galvani, was studying the effects of electricity upon
animal organisms, using for the purpose the legs of freshly
killed frogs. In the course of his experiments he happened
to hang against an iron window rail a bundle of frogs’ legs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
fastened together with a piece of copper wire, and he
noticed that the legs began to twitch in a peculiar manner.
He knew that a frog’s leg would twitch when electricity
was applied to it, and he concluded that the twitchings in
this case were caused in the same way. So far he was
quite right, but then came the problem of how any
electricity could be produced in these circumstances, and
here he went astray. It
never occurred to him that
the source of the electricity
might be found in something
quite apart from the legs,
and so he came to the conclusion
that the phenomenon
was due to electricity produced
in some mysterious
way in the tissues of the
animal itself. He therefore
announced that he had discovered
the existence of a
kind of animal electricity,
and it was left for his fellow-countryman,
Alessandro
Volta, to prove that the
twitchings were due to electricity
produced by the contact
of the two metals, the iron of the window rail and the
copper wire.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—Voltaic Pile.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Volta found that when two different metals were placed in
contact in air, one became positively charged, and the other
negatively. These charges however were extremely feeble,
and in his endeavours to obtain stronger results he hit upon
the idea of using a number of pairs of metals, and he constructed
the apparatus known as the Voltaic pile, <a href="#fig_6" class="pginternal">Fig. 6</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
This consists of a number of pairs of zinc and copper
discs, each pair being separated from the next pair by a
disc of cloth moistened with salt water. These are piled
up and placed in a frame, as shown in the figure. One
end of the pile thus terminates in a zinc disc, and the other
in a copper disc, and as soon as the two are connected by
a wire or other conductor a continuous current of electricity
is produced. The cause of the electricity produced by the
voltaic pile was the subject of
a long and heated controversy.
There were two main theories;
that of Volta himself, which
attributed the electricity to the
mere contact of unlike metals,
and the chemical theory, which
ascribed it to chemical action.
The chemical theory is now
generally accepted, but certain
points, into which we need not
enter, are still in dispute.</p>

<p>There is a curious experiment
which some of my readers
may like to try. Place a copper
coin on a sheet of zinc, and set an
ordinary garden snail to crawl
across the zinc towards the coin. As soon as the snail
comes in contact with the copper it shrinks back, and shows
every sign of having received a shock. One can well
imagine that an enthusiastic gardener pestered with snails
would watch this experiment with great glee.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Simple Voltaic Cell.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Volta soon found that it was not necessary to have his
pairs of metals in actual metallic contact, and that better
results were got by placing them in a vessel filled with
dilute acid. <a href="#fig_7" class="pginternal">Fig. 7</a> is a diagram of a simple voltaic cell of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
this kind, and it shows the direction of the current when
the zinc and the copper are connected by the wire. In
order to get some idea of the reason why a current flows
we must understand the meaning of electric potential. If
water is poured into a vessel, a certain water pressure is
produced. The amount of this pressure depends upon the
level of the water, and this in turn depends upon the
quantity of water and the capacity of the vessel, for a
given quantity of water will reach a higher level in a small
vessel than in a larger one. In the same way, if electricity
is imparted to a conductor an electric pressure is
produced, its amount depending upon the quantity of
electricity and the electric capacity of the conductor, for
conductors vary in capacity just as water vessels do.</p>

<p>This electric pressure is called “potential,” and electricity
tends to flow from a conductor of higher to one of lower
potential. When we say that a place is so many feet
above or below sea-level we are using the level of the sea
as a zero level, and in estimating electric potential we take
the potential of the earth’s surface as zero; and we regard
a positively electrified body as one at a positive or relatively
high potential, and a negatively electrified body as
one at a negative or relatively low potential. This may be
clearer if we think of temperature and the thermometer.
Temperatures above zero are positive and represented by
the sign +, and those below zero are negative and represented
by the sign -. Thus we assume that an electric
current flows from a positive to a negative conductor.</p>

<p>In a voltaic cell the plates are at different potentials, so
that when they are connected by a wire a current flows,
and we say that the current leaves the cell at the positive
terminal, and enters it again at the negative terminal. As
shown in <a href="#fig_7" class="pginternal">Fig. 7</a>, the current moves in opposite directions
inside and outside the cell, making a complete round called
a <em>circuit</em>, and if the circuit is broken anywhere the current
ceases to flow. If the circuit is complete the current keeps
on flowing, trying to equalize the electric pressure or
potential, but it is unable to do this because the chemical
action between the acid and the zinc maintains the difference
of potential between the plates. This chemical action
results in wasting of the zinc and weakening of the acid,
and as long as it continues the current keeps on flowing.
When we wish to stop the current we break the circuit by
disconnecting the wire joining the terminals, and the cell
then should be at rest; but owing to the impurities in
ordinary commercial zinc chemical action still continues.
In order to prevent wasting when the current is not required
the surface of the zinc is coated with a thin film of
mercury. The zinc is then said to be amalgamated, and
it is not acted upon by the acid so long as the circuit
remains broken.</p>

<p>The current from a simple voltaic cell does not remain
at a constant strength, but after a short time it begins to
weaken rapidly. The cell is then said to be polarized, and
this polarization is caused by bubbles of hydrogen gas
which accumulate on the surface of the copper plate during
the chemical action. These bubbles of gas weaken the
current partly by resisting its flow, for they are bad conductors,
and still more by trying to set up another current
in the opposite direction. For this reason the simple
voltaic cell is unsuitable for long spells of work, and many
cells have been devised to avoid the polarization trouble.
One of the most successful of these is the Daniell cell. It
consists of an outer vessel of copper, which serves as the
copper plate, and an inner porous pot containing a zinc
rod. Dilute sulphuric acid is put into the porous pot and
a strong solution of copper sulphate into the outer jar.
When the circuit is closed, the hydrogen liberated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
action of the zinc on the acid passes through the porous
pot, and splits up the copper sulphate into copper and
sulphuric acid. In this way pure copper, instead of
hydrogen, is deposited on the copper plate, no polarization
takes place, and the current is constant.</p>

<p>Other cells have different combinations of metals, such
as silver-zinc, or platinum-zinc, and carbon is also largely
used in place of one metal, as in the familiar carbon-zinc
Leclanché cell, used for ringing electric bells. This cell
consists of an inner porous pot containing a carbon plate
packed round with a mixture of crushed carbon and manganese
dioxide, and an outer glass jar containing a zinc
rod and a solution of sal-ammoniac. Polarization is
checked by the oxygen in the manganese dioxide, which
seizes the hydrogen on its way to the carbon plate, and
combines with it. If the cell is used continuously however
this action cannot keep pace with the rate at which the
hydrogen is produced, and so the cell becomes polarized;
but it soon recovers after a short rest.</p>

<p>The so-called “dry” cells so much used at the present
time are not really dry at all; if they were they would give
no current. They are in fact Leclanché cells, in which
the containing vessel is made of zinc to take the place of a
zinc rod; and they are dry only in the sense that the liquid
is taken up by an absorbent material, so as to form a moist
paste. Dry cells are placed inside closely fitting cardboard
tubes, and are sealed up at the top. Their chief advantage
lies in their portability, for as there is no free liquid to
spill they can be carried about and placed in any position.</p>

<p>We have seen that the continuance of the current from
a voltaic cell depends upon the keeping up of a difference
of potential between the plates. The force which serves
to maintain this difference is called the electro-motive force,
and it is measured in volts. The actual flow of electricity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
is measured in amperes. Probably all my readers are
familiar with the terms volt and ampere, but perhaps some
may not be quite clear about the distinction between the
two. When water flows along a pipe we know that it is
being forced to do so by pressure resulting from a difference
of level. That is to say, a difference of level produces
a water-moving or water-motive force; and in a
similar way a difference of potential produces an electricity-moving
or electro-motive force, which is measured
in volts. If we wish to describe the rate of flow of water
we state it in gallons per second, and the rate of flow of
electricity is stated in amperes. Volts thus represent the
pressure at which a current is supplied, while the current
itself is measured in amperes.</p>

<p>We may take this opportunity of speaking of electric
resistance. A current of water flowing through a pipe is
resisted by friction against the inner surface of the pipe;
and a current of electricity flowing through a circuit also
meets with a resistance, though this is not due to friction.
In a good conductor this resistance is small, but in a bad
conductor or non-conductor it is very great. The resistance
also depends upon length and area of cross-section; so that
a long wire offers more resistance than a short one, and a
thin wire more than a thick one. Before any current can
flow in a circuit the electro-motive force must overcome
the resistance, and we might say that the volts drive the
amperes through the resistance. The unit of resistance is
the ohm, and the definition of a volt is that electro-motive
force which will cause a current of one ampere to flow
through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm. These
units of measurement are named after three famous scientists,
Volta, Ampère, and Ohm.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>—Cells connected in Parallel.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>A number of cells coupled together form a battery, and
different methods of coupling are used to get different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
results. In addition to the resistance of the circuit outside
the cell, the cell itself offers an internal resistance, and part
of the electro-motive force is used up in overcoming this
resistance. If we can decrease this internal resistance we
shall have a larger current at our disposal, and one way of
doing this is to increase the size of the plates. This of
course means making the cell larger, and very large cells
take up a lot of room and are troublesome to move about.
We can get the same effect however by coupling. If we
connect together all the positive terminals and all the
negative terminals of several cells, that is, copper to copper
and zinc to zinc in Daniell cells, we get the same result as
if we had one very large cell. The current is much larger,
but the electro-motive force remains the same as if only
one cell were used, or in other words we have more amperes
but no more volts. This is called connecting in “parallel,”
and the method is shown in <a href="#fig_8" class="pginternal">Fig. 8</a>. On the other hand,
if, as is usually the case, we want a larger electro-motive
force, we connect the positive terminal of one cell to the
negative terminal of the next, or copper to zinc all through.
In this way we add together the electro-motive forces of all
the cells, but the amount of current remains that of a single
cell; that is, we get more volts but no more amperes. This is
called connecting in “series,” and the arrangement is shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
in <a href="#fig_9" class="pginternal">Fig. 9</a>. We can also increase both volts and amperes by
combining the two methods.</p>

<p>A voltaic cell gives us a considerable quantity of
electricity at low pressure, the electro-motive force of a
Leclanché cell being about 1½ volts, and that of a Daniell
cell about 1 volt. We may perhaps get some idea of the
electrical conditions existing during a thunderstorm from
the fact that to produce a spark one mile long through air
at ordinary pressure we should require a battery of more
than a thousand million Daniell cells. Cells such as we
have described in this chapter are called primary cells, as
distinguished from accumulators, which are called secondary
cells. Some of the practical applications of primary cells
will be described in later chapters.</p>

<p>Besides the voltaic cell, in which the current is produced
by chemical action, there is the thermo-electric battery, or
thermopile, which produces current directly from heat
energy. About 1822 Seebeck was experimenting with
voltaic pairs of metals, and he found that a current could
be produced in a complete metallic circuit consisting of
different metals joined together, by keeping these joinings
at different temperatures. <a href="#fig_10" class="pginternal">Fig. 10</a> shows a simple arrangement
for demonstrating this effect, which is known as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
“Seebeck effect.” A slab of bismuth, BB, has placed upon it
a bent strip of copper, C. If one of the junctions of the
two metals is heated as shown, a current flows; and the
same effect is produced
by cooling one of the
junctions. This current
continues to flow
as long as the two junctions
are kept at different
temperatures. In
1834 another scientist,
Peltier, discovered that
if a current was passed
across a junction of two different metals, this junction was
either heated or cooled, according to the direction in which
the current flowed. In <a href="#fig_10" class="pginternal">Fig. 10</a> the current across the
heated junction tends to cool the junction, while the Bunsen
burner opposes this cooling, and keeps up the temperature.
A certain amount of the heat energy is thus transformed
into electrical
energy. At the
other junction
the current
produces a
heating effect,
so that some of
the electrical
energy is retransformed
into heat.</p>

<p>A thermopile consists of a number of alternate bars or
strips of two unlike metals, joined together as shown
diagrammatically in <a href="#fig_11" class="pginternal">Fig. 11</a>. The arrangement is such
that the odd junctions are at one side, and the even ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
at the other. The odd junctions are heated, and the even
ones cooled, and a current flows when the circuit is completed.
By using a larger number of junctions, and by
increasing the difference of temperature between them, the
voltage of the current may be increased. Thermopiles are
nothing like so efficient as voltaic cells, and they are more
costly. They are used to a limited extent for purposes
requiring a very small and constant current, but for
generating considerable quantities of current at high
pressure they are quite useless. The only really important
practical use of the thermopile is in the detection and
measurement of very minute differences of temperature,
which are beyond the capabilities of the ordinary thermometer.
Within certain limits, the electro-motive force of a
thermopile is exactly proportionate to the difference of
temperature. The very slightest difference of temperature
produces a current, and by connecting the wires from a
specially constructed thermopile to a delicate instrument
for measuring the strength of the current, temperature
differences of less than one-millionth of a degree can be
detected.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> we had two large water tanks, one of which could be
emptied only by allowing the bottom to fall completely out,
and the other by means of a narrow pipe, it is easy to see
which would be the more useful to us as a source of water
supply. If both tanks were filled, then from the first we
could get only a sudden uncontrollable rush of water, but
from the other we could get a steady stream extending over
a long period, and easily controlled. The Leyden jar stores
electricity, but in yielding up its store it acts like the first
tank, giving a sudden discharge in the form of a bright
spark. We cannot control the discharge, and therefore we
cannot make it do useful work for us. For practical
purposes we require a storing arrangement that will act like
the second tank, giving us a steady current of electricity
for a long period, and this we have in the accumulator or
storage cell.</p>

<p>A current of electricity has the power of decomposing
certain liquids. If we pass a current through water, the
water is split up into its two constituent gases, hydrogen
and oxygen, and this may be shown by the apparatus seen
in <a href="#fig_12" class="pginternal">Fig. 12</a>. It consists of a glass vessel with two strips of
platinum to which the current is led. The vessel contains
water to which has been added a little sulphuric acid to
increase its conducting power, and over the strips are inverted
two test-tubes filled with the acidulated water. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
platinum strips, which are called <em>electrodes</em>, are connected
to a battery of Daniell cells. When the current passes,
the water is decomposed, and oxygen collects at the electrode
connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and
hydrogen at the other electrode. The two gases rise up
into the test-tubes and displace the water in them, and the
whole process is called the electrolysis of water. If now
we disconnect the battery and join the two electrodes by
a wire, we find that a current flows from the apparatus
as from a voltaic cell, but
in the opposite direction
from the original battery
current.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Diagram showing Electrolysis
of Water.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>It will be remembered
that one of the troubles
with a simple voltaic cell
was polarization, caused
by the accumulation of
hydrogen; and that this
weakened the current by
setting up an opposing
electro-motive force tending
to produce another
current in the opposite
direction. In the present
case a similar opposing or back electro-motive force is
produced, and as soon as the battery current is stopped
and the electrodes are connected, we get a current in the
reverse direction, and this current continues to flow until
the two gases have recombined, and the electrodes have
regained their original condition. Consequently we can
see that in order to electrolyze water, our battery must
have an electro-motive force greater than that set up in
opposition to it, and at least two Daniell cells are required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>This apparatus thus may be made to serve to some
extent as an accumulator or storage cell, and it also serves
to show that an accumulator does not store up or accumulate
electricity. In a voltaic cell we have chemical energy
converted into electrical energy, and here we have first
electrical energy converted into chemical energy, and then
the chemical energy converted back again into electrical
energy. This is a rough-and-ready way of putting the
matter, but it is good enough for practical purposes, and at
any rate it makes it quite clear that what an accumulator
really stores up is not electricity, but energy, which is given
out in the form of electricity.</p>

<p>The apparatus just described is of little use as a source
of current, and the first really practical accumulator was
made in 1878 by Gaston Planté. The electrodes were two
strips of sheet lead placed one upon the other, but separated
by some insulating material, and made into a roll. This
roll was placed in dilute sulphuric acid, and one strip or
plate connected to the positive, and the other to the
negative terminal of the source of current. The current
was passed for a certain length of time, and then the accumulator
partly discharged; after which current was passed
again, but in the reverse direction, followed by another period
of discharge. This process, which is called <em>forming</em>,
was continued for several days, and its effect was to change
one plate into a spongy condition, and to form a coating
of peroxide of lead on the other. When the plates were
properly formed the accumulator was ready to be fully
charged and put into use. The effect of charging was to
rob one plate of its oxygen, and to transfer this oxygen to
the other plate, which thus received an overcharge of the
gas. During the discharge of the accumulator the excess
of oxygen went back to the place from which it had been
taken, and the current continued until the surfaces of both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
plates were reduced to a chemically inactive state. The
accumulator could be charged and discharged over and
over again as long as the plates remained in good order.</p>

<p>In 1881, Faure hit upon the idea of coating the plates
with a paste of red-lead, and this greatly shortened the
time of forming. At first it was found difficult to make the
paste stick to the plates, but this trouble was got rid of by
making the plates in the form of grids, and pressing the
paste into the perforations. Many further improvements
have been made from time to time, but instead of tracing
these we will go on at once to the description of a present-day
accumulator. There are now many excellent accumulators
made, but we have not space to consider more than
one, and we will select that known as the “Chloride”
accumulator.</p>

<p>The positive plate of this accumulator is of the Planté
type, but it is not simply a casting of pure lead, but is made
by a building-up process which allows of the use of a
lead-antimony mixture for the grids. This gives greater
strength, and the grids themselves are unaffected by the
chemical changes which take place during the charging and
discharging of the cell. The active material, that is the
material which undergoes chemical change, is pure lead
tape coiled up into rosettes, which are so designed that the
acid can circulate through the plates. These rosettes are
driven into the perforations of the grid by a hydraulic press,
and during the process of forming they expand and thus
become very firmly fixed. The negative plate has a frame
made in two parts, which are riveted together after the
insertion of the active material, which is thus contained in
a number of small cages. The plate is covered outside
with a finely perforated sheet of lead, which prevents the
active material from falling out. It is of the utmost
importance that the positive and negative plates should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
kept apart when in the cell, and in the Chloride accumulator
this is ensured by the use of a patent separator made of
a thin sheet of wood the size of the plates. Before being
used the wood undergoes a special treatment to remove all
substances which might be harmful, and it then remains
unchanged either in appearance or composition. Other
insulating substances, such as glass rods or ebonite forks,
can be used as separators, but it is claimed that the wood
separator is not only more satisfactory, but that in some
unexplained way it actually helps to keep up the capacity
of the cell. The plates are placed in glass, or lead-lined
wood or metal boxes, and are suspended from above the
dilute sulphuric acid with which the cells are filled. A
space is left below the plates for the sediment which
accumulates during the working of the cell.</p>

<p>In all but the smallest cells several pairs of plates are
used, all the positive plates being connected together and
all the negative plates. This gives the same effect as two
very large plates, on the principle of connecting in parallel,
spoken of in <a href="#chapter_IV" class="pginternal">Chapter IV</a>. A single cell, of whatever size,
gives current at about two volts, and to get higher voltages
many cells are connected in series, as with primary cells.
The capacity is generally measured in ampere-hours. For
instance, an accumulator that will give a current of eight
amperes for one hour, or of four amperes for two hours, or
one ampere for eight hours, is said to have a capacity of
eight ampere-hours.</p>

<p>Accumulators are usually charged from a dynamo or
from the public mains, and the electro-motive force of
the charging current must be not less than 2½ volts for
each cell, in order to overcome the back electro-motive
force of the cells themselves. It is possible to charge
accumulators from primary cells, but except on a very
small scale the process is comparatively expensive. Non-polarizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
cells, such as the Daniell, must be used for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The practical applications of accumulators are almost
innumerable, and year by year they increase. As the most
important of these are connected with the use of electricity
for power and light, it will be more convenient to speak of
them in the chapters dealing with this subject. Minor
uses of accumulators will be referred to briefly from time
to time in other chapters.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> many parts of the world there is to be found a kind of
iron ore, some specimens of which have the peculiar power
of attracting iron, and of turning to the north if suspended
freely. This is called the <em>lodestone</em>, and it has been
known from very remote times. The name Magnetism has
been given to this strange property of the lodestone, but the
origin of the name is not definitely known. There is an
old story about a shepherd named Magnes, who lived in
Phrygia in Asia Minor. One day, while tending his sheep
on Mount Ida, he happened to touch a dark coloured rock
with the iron end of his crook, and he was astonished and
alarmed to find that the rock was apparently alive, for it
gripped his crook so firmly that he could not pull it away.
This rock is said to have been a mass of lodestone, and
some people believe that the name magnet comes from the
shepherd Magnes. Others think that the name is derived
from Magnesia, in Asia Minor, where the lodestone was
found in large quantities; while a third theory finds the
origin in the Latin word <i lang="la">magnus</i>, heavy, on account of the
heavy nature of the lodestone. The word lodestone itself
comes from the Saxon <i lang="osx">laeden</i>, meaning to lead.</p>

<p>It is fairly certain that the Chinese knew of the lodestone
long before Greek and Roman times, and according
to ancient Chinese records this knowledge extends as far
back as 2600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Humboldt, in his <cite>Cosmos</cite>, states that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
miniature figure of a man which always turned to the south
was used by the Chinese to guide their caravans across the
plains of Tartary as early as 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The ancient Greek
and Roman writers frequently refer to the lodestone.
Thales, of whom we spoke in <a href="#chapter_I" class="pginternal">Chapter I</a>., believed that its
mysterious power was due to the possession of a soul, and
the Roman poet Claudian imagined that iron was a food
for which the lodestone was hungry. Our limited space
will not allow of an account of the many curious speculations
to which the lodestone has given rise, but the following
suggestion of one Famianus Strada, quoted from
Houston’s <cite>Electricity in Every-Day Life</cite>, is really too
good to be omitted.</p>

<p>“Let there be two needles provided of an equal Length
and Bigness, being both of them touched by the same
lodestone; let the Letters of the Alphabet be placed on the
Circles on which they are moved, as the Points of the
Compass under the needle of the Mariner’s Chart. Let
the Friend that is to travel take one of these with him, first
agreeing upon the Days and Hours wherein they should
confer together; at which times, if one of them move the
Needle, the other Needle, by Sympathy, will move unto
the same letter in the other instantly, though they are
never so far distant; and thus, by several Motions of the
Needle to the Letters, they may easily make up any Words
or Sense which they have a mind to express.” This is
wireless telegraphy in good earnest!</p>

<p>The lodestone is a natural magnet. If we rub a piece
of steel with a lodestone we find that it acquires the same
properties as the latter, and in this way we are able to
make any number of magnets, for the lodestone does not
lose any of its own magnetism in the process. Such
magnets are called artificial magnets. Iron is easier to
magnetize than steel, but it soon loses its magnetism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
whereas steel retains it; and the harder the steel the better
it keeps its magnetism. Artificial magnets, therefore, are
made of specially hardened steel. In this chapter we shall
refer only to steel magnets, as they are much more convenient
to use than the lodestone, but it should be
remembered that both act in exactly the same way. We
will suppose that we have a pair of bar magnets, and a
horse-shoe magnet, as shown in <a href="#fig_13" class="pginternal">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<figure class="figleft" style="max-width: 16em;" id="fig_13">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—Horse-shoe and Bar Magnets,
with Keepers.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>If we roll a bar magnet amongst iron filings we find
that the filings remain
clinging to it in two
tufts, one at each
end, and that few or
none adhere to the
middle. These two
points towards which
the filings are attracted
are called the
poles of the magnet.
Each pole attracts
filings or ordinary
needles, and one or
two experiments will
show that the attraction
becomes evident while the magnet is still some little
distance away. If, however, we test our magnet with other
substances, such as wood, glass, paper, brass, etc., we see
that there is no attraction whatever.</p>

<p>If one of our bar magnets is suspended in a sort of
stirrup of copper wire attached to a thread, it comes to rest
in a north and south direction, and it will be noticed that
the end which points to the north is marked, either with a
letter N or in some other way. This is the north pole of
the magnet, and of course the other is the south pole. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
now we take our other magnet and bring its north pole
near each pole of the suspended magnet in turn, we find
that it repels the other north pole, but attracts the south
pole. Similarly, if we present the south pole, it repels the
other south pole, but attracts the north pole. From these
experiments we learn that both poles of a magnet attract
filings or needles, and that in the case of two magnets
unlike poles attract, but similar poles repel one another.
It will be noticed that this corresponds closely with the
results of our experiments in <a href="#chapter_I" class="pginternal">Chapter I</a>., which showed
that an electrified body attracts unelectrified bodies, such
as bits of paper or pith balls, and that unlike charges
attract, and similar charges repel each other. So far as we
have seen, however, a magnet attracts only iron or steel,
whereas an electrified body attracts any light substance.
As a matter of fact, certain other substances, such as nickel
and cobalt, are attracted by a magnet, but not so readily as
iron and steel; while bismuth, antimony, phosphorus, and
a few other substances are feebly repelled.</p>

<p>The simplest method of magnetizing a piece of steel by
means of one of our bar magnets is the following: Lay the
steel on the table, and draw one pole of the magnet along
it from end to end; lift the magnet clear of the steel, and
repeat the process several times, always starting at the
same end and treating each surface of the steel in turn. A
thin, flat bar of steel is the best for the purpose, but steel
knitting needles may be made in this way into useful
experimental magnets.</p>

<p>We have seen that a magnet has two poles or points
where the magnetism is strongest. It might be thought
that by breaking a bar magnet in the middle we should get
two small bars each with a single pole, but this is not the
case, for the two poles are inseparable. However many
pieces we break a magnet into, each piece is a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
magnet having a north and south pole. Thus while we
can isolate a positive or a negative charge of electricity, we
cannot isolate north or south magnetism.</p>

<p>If we place the north pole of a bar magnet near to, but
not touching, a bar of soft iron, as in <a href="#plate_IIa" class="pginternal">Plate II.<i>a</i></a>, we find that
the latter becomes a magnet, as shown by its ability to
support filings; and that as soon as the magnet is removed
the filings drop off, showing that the iron has lost its
magnetism. If the iron is tested while the magnet is in
position it is found to have a south pole at the end nearer
the magnet, and a north pole at the end farther away; and
if the magnet is reversed, so as to bring its south pole
nearer the iron, the poles of the latter are found to reverse
also. The iron has gained its new properties by magnetic
induction, and we cannot fail to notice the similarity between
this experiment and that in <a href="#fig_2" class="pginternal">Fig. 2</a>, <a href="#chapter_II" class="pginternal">Chapter II</a>., which
showed electro-static induction. A positively or a negatively
electrified body induces an opposite charge at the
nearer end, and a similar charge at the further end of a
conductor, and a north or a south pole of a magnet
induces opposite polarity at the nearer end, and a
similar polarity at the further end of a bar of iron. In
<a href="#chapter_II" class="pginternal">Chapter II</a>. we showed that the attraction of a pith ball
by an electrified body was due to induction, and from what
we have just learnt about magnetic induction the reader
will have no difficulty in understanding why a magnet
attracts filings or needles.</p>

ELECTRIC CURRENT.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Any one who experiments with magnets must be struck
with the distance at which one magnet can influence filings
or another magnet. If a layer of iron filings is spread on a
sheet of paper, and a magnet brought gradually nearer
from above, the filings soon begin to move about restlessly,
and when the magnet comes close enough they fly up to it
as if pulled by invisible strings. A still more striking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
experiment consists in spreading filings thinly over a sheet
of cardboard and moving a magnet to and fro underneath
the sheet. The result is most amusing. The filings seem
to stand up on their hind legs, and they march about like
regiments of soldiers. Here again invisible strings are
suggested, and we might wonder whether there really is
anything of the kind. Yes, there is. To put the matter
in the simplest way, the magnet acts by means of strings
or lines of force, which emerge from it in definite directions,
and in a most interesting way we can see some of these
lines of force actually at work.</p>

<p>Place a magnet, or any arrangement of magnets, underneath
a sheet of glass, and sprinkle iron filings from a
muslin bag thinly and evenly all over the glass. Then tap
the glass gently with a pencil, and the filings at once
arrange themselves in a most remarkable manner. All the
filings become magnetized by induction, and when the tap
sets them free for an instant from the friction of the glass
they take up definite positions under the influence of the
force acting upon them. In this way we get a map of
the general direction of the magnetic lines of force, which
are our invisible strings.</p>

<p>Many different maps may be made in this way, but we
have space for only two. <a href="#plate_III" class="pginternal">Plate III.<i>a</i></a> shows the lines of two
opposite poles. Notice how they appear to stream across
from one pole to the other. It is believed that there is a
tension along the lines of force not unlike that in stretched
elastic bands, and if this is so it is easy to see from the
figure why opposite poles attract each other.</p>

<p><a href="#plate_III" class="pginternal">Plate III.<i>b</i></a> shows the lines of force of two similar poles.
In this case they do not stream from pole to pole, but turn
aside as if repelling one another, and from this figure we
see why there is repulsion between two similar poles. It
can be shown, although in a much less simple manner, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
lines of electric force proceed from electrified bodies, and
in electric attraction and repulsion between two charged
bodies the lines of force take paths which closely resemble
those in our two figures. A space filled with lines of
magnetic force is called a <em>magnetic field</em>, and one filled
with lines of electric force is called an <em>electric field</em>.</p>

<p>A horse-shoe magnet, which is simply a bar of steel
bent into the shape of a horse-shoe before being magnetized,
gradually loses its magnetism if left with its poles
unprotected, but this loss is prevented if the poles are
connected by a piece of soft iron. The same loss occurs
with a bar magnet, but as the two poles cannot be connected
in this way it is customary to keep two bar magnets side
by side, separated by a strip of wood; with opposite poles
together and a piece of soft iron across the ends. Such
pieces of iron are called <em>keepers</em>, and <a href="#fig_13" class="pginternal">Fig. 13</a> shows a
horse-shoe magnet and a pair of bar magnets with their
keepers. It may be remarked that a magnet never should
be knocked or allowed to fall, as rough usage of this kind
causes it to lose a considerable amount of its magnetism.
A magnet is injured also by allowing the keeper to slam on
to it; but pulling the keeper off vigorously does good
instead of harm.</p>

<p>If a magnetized needle is suspended so that it is free to
swing either horizontally or vertically, it not only comes
to rest in a north and south direction, but also it tilts with
its north-pointing end downwards. If the needle were
taken to a place south of the equator it would still tilt, but
the south-pointing end would be downwards. In both
cases the angle the needle makes with the horizontal is
called the <em>magnetic dip</em>.</p>

  <p class="smaller">(<i>b</i>) LINES OF MAGNETIC FORCE OF TWO SIMILAR POLES.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>It is evident that a suspended magnetized needle would
not invariably come to rest pointing north and south unless
it were compelled to do so, and a little consideration shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
that the needle acts as if it were under the influence of a
magnet. Dr. Gilbert of Colchester, of whom we spoke in
<a href="#chapter_I" class="pginternal">Chapter I</a>., gave a great deal of time to the study of
magnetic phenomena, and in 1600 he announced what may
be regarded as his greatest discovery: <em>The terrestrial
globe itself is a great magnet</em>. Here, then, is the explanation
of the behaviour of the magnetized needle. The Earth
itself is a great magnet, having its poles near to the
geographical north and south poles. But a question at
once suggests itself: “Since similar poles repel one another,
how is it that the north pole of a magnet turns towards the
north magnetic pole of the earth?” This apparent difficulty
is caused by a confusion in terms. If the Earth’s
north magnetic pole really has north magnetism, then the
north-pointing end of a magnet must be a south pole; and
on the other hand, if the north-pointing end of a magnet
has north magnetism, then the Earth’s north magnetic pole
must be really a south pole. It is a troublesome matter to
settle, but it is now customary to regard the Earth’s north
magnetic pole as possessing south magnetism, and the
south magnetic pole as possessing north magnetism. In
this way the north-pointing pole of a magnet may be looked
upon as a true north pole, and the south-pointing pole as a
true south pole.</p>

<p>Magnetic dip also is seen to be a natural result of the
Earth’s magnetic influence. Here in England, for instance,
the north magnetic pole is much nearer than the south
magnetic pole, and consequently its influence is the
stronger. Therefore a magnetized needle, if free to do
so, dips downwards towards the north. At any place
where the south magnetic pole is the nearer the direction
of the dip of course is reversed. If placed immediately
over either magnetic pole the needle would take up a
vertical position, and at the magnetic equator it would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
dip at all, for the influence of the two magnetic poles would
be equal. A little study of <a href="#fig_14" class="pginternal">Fig. 14</a>, which represents a
dipping needle at different parts of the earth, will make
this matter clearer. N and S represent the Earth’s north
and south magnetic poles, and the arrow heads are the
north poles of the needles.</p>

<figure class="figleft" style="max-width: 16em;" id="fig_14">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>—Diagram to illustrate Magnetic Dip.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Since the Earth is a magnet, we should expect it to
be able to induce magnetism in a bar of iron, just as our
artificial magnets do, and we can show that this is actually
the case. If a steel poker is held pointing to and dipping
down towards the
north, and struck
sharply with a piece
of wood while in this
position, it acquires
magnetic properties
which can be tested
by means of a small
compass needle. It
is an interesting fact
that iron pillars and
railings which have
been standing for a
long time in one position are found to be magnetized.
In the northern hemisphere the bases of upright iron
pillars are north poles, and their upper ends south poles,
and in the southern hemisphere the polarity is reversed.</p>

<p>The most valuable application of the magnetic needle
is in the compass. An ordinary pocket compass for inland
use consists simply of a single magnetized needle pivoted
so as to swing freely over a card on which are marked the
thirty-two points of the compass. Ships’ compasses are
much more elaborate. As a rule a compound needle is
used, consisting of eight slender strips of steel, magnetized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
separately, and suspended side by side. A compound
needle of this kind is very much more reliable than a
single needle. The material of which the card is made
depends upon whether the illumination for night work is
to come from above or below. If the latter, the card must
be transparent, and it is often made of thin sheet mica;
but if the light comes from above, the card is made of
some opaque material, such as very stout paper. The
needle and card are contained in a sort of bowl made of
copper. In order to keep this bowl in a horizontal position,
however the ship may be pitching and rolling, it is supported
on gimbals, which are two concentric rings attached
to horizontal pivots, and moving in axes at right angles
to one another. Further stability may be obtained by
weighting the bottom of the bowl with lead. There are
also liquid compasses, in which the card is floated on the
surface of dilute alcohol, and many modern ships’ compasses
have their movements regulated by a gyrostat.</p>

<p>The large amount of iron and steel used in the construction
of modern vessels has a considerable effect upon
the compass needle, and unless the compass is protected
from this influence its readings are liable to serious errors.
The most satisfactory way of giving this protection is by
placing on each side of the compass a large globe of soft
iron, twelve or more inches in diameter.</p>

<p>On account of the fact that the magnetic poles of the
Earth do not coincide with the geographical north and
south poles, a compass needle seldom points exactly north
and south, and the angle between the magnetic meridian
and the geographical meridian is called the <em>declination</em>.
The discovery that the declination varies in different parts
of the world was made by Columbus in 1492. For purposes
of navigation it is obviously very important that the
declination at all points of the Earth’s surface should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
known, and special magnetic maps are prepared in which
all places having the same declination are joined by a
line.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that the Earth’s magnetism is
subject to variation. The declination and the dip slowly
change through long periods of years, and there are also
slight annual and even daily variations.</p>

<p>At one time magnets were credited with extraordinary
effects upon the human body. Small doses of lodestone,
ground to powder and mixed with water, were supposed
to prolong life, and Paracelsus, a famous alchemist and
physician, born in Switzerland in 1493, believed in the
potency of lodestone ointment for wounds made with steel
weapons. Baron Reichenbach, 1788–1860, believed that
he had discovered the existence of a peculiar physical force
closely connected with magnetism, and he gave this force
the name <em>Od</em>. It was supposed to exist everywhere,
and, like magnetism, to have two poles, positive and
negative; the left side of the body being od-positive, and
the right side od-negative. Certain individuals, known as
“sensitives,” were said to be specially open to its influence.
These people stated that they saw strange flickering lights
at the poles of magnets, and that they experienced peculiar
sensations when a magnet was passed over them. Some
of them indeed were unable to sleep on the left side, because
the north pole of the Earth, being od-negative, had
a bad effect on the od-negative left side. The pretended
revelations of these “sensitives” created a great stir at the
time, but now nobody believes in the existence of <em>Od</em>.</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall was once invited to a seance, with
the object of convincing him of the genuineness of spiritualism.
He sat beside a young lady who claimed to have
spiritualistic powers, and his record of his conversation with
her is amusing. The Reichenbach craze was in full swing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
at the time, and Tyndall asked if the lady could see any of
the weird lights supposed to be visible to “sensitives.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Medium.</i>—Oh yes; but I see the light around all
bodies.</p>

<p><i>I.</i>—Even in perfect darkness?</p>

<p><i>Medium.</i>—Yes; I see luminous atmospheres round
all people. The atmosphere which surrounds
Mr. R. C. would fill this room with light.</p>

<p><i>I.</i>—You are aware of the effects ascribed by Baron
Reichenbach to magnets?</p>

<p><i>Medium.</i>—Yes; but a magnet makes me terribly ill.</p>

<p><i>I.</i>—Am I to understand that, if this room were
perfectly dark, you could tell whether it contained
a magnet, without being informed of

<p><i>Medium.</i>—I should know of its presence on entering

<p><i>I.</i>—How?</p>

<p><i>Medium.</i>—I should be rendered instantly ill.</p>

well for months.</p>

<p><i>I.</i>—Then, may I ask you whether there is, at the

<p>The young lady looked at me, blushed, and
stammered, ‘No; I am not <i>en rapport</i> with

<p><em>I sat at her right hand, and a left-hand pocket,
within six inches of her person, contained a

<span class="subhead">THE PRODUCTION OF MAGNETISM BY ELECTRICITY</span></h2>
</div>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>—Diagram to illustrate Magnetic effect of an Electric Current.
</figcaption></figure>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the previous chapter attention was drawn to the fact
that there are many close parallels between electric and
magnetic phenomena, and in this chapter it will be shown
that magnetism can be produced by electricity. In the
year 1819 Professor Oersted, of the University of Copenhagen,
discovered that a freely swinging magnetized needle,
such as a compass needle, was deflected by a current of
electricity flowing through a wire. In <a href="#fig_15" class="pginternal">Fig. 15</a>, A, a
magnetic needle is shown at rest in its usual north and
south direction, and over it is held a copper wire, also
pointing north and south. A current of electricity is now
sent through the wire, and the needle is at once deflected,
<a href="#fig_15" class="pginternal">Fig. 15</a>, B. The direction of the current is indicated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
an arrow, and the direction in which the needle has moved
is shown by the two small arrows. If the direction of the
current is reversed, the needle will be deflected in the
opposite direction. From this experiment we see that the
current has brought magnetic influences into play, or in
other words has produced magnetism. If iron filings are
brought near the wire while the current is flowing, they
are at once attracted and cling to the wire, but as soon as
the current is stopped
they drop off. This
shows us that the wire
itself becomes a magnet
during the passage of
the current, and that it
loses its magnetism
when the current ceases
to flow.</p>

<figure class="figright" style="max-width: 15em;" id="fig_16">
  <img alt=" " height="1174" src="images/i_073.jpg" width="1180" id="id-8620837263558942752">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Magnetic Field round wire
conveying a Current.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Further, it can be
shown that two freely
moving parallel wires
conveying currents attract
or repel one
another according to
the direction of the currents.
If both currents are flowing in the same direction
the wires attract one another, but if the currents flow in
opposite directions the wires repel each other. <a href="#fig_16" class="pginternal">Fig. 16</a>
shows the direction of the lines of force of a wire conveying
a current and passed through a horizontal piece of cardboard
covered with a thin layer of iron filings; and from this
figure it is evident that the passage of the current produces
what we may call magnetic whirls round the wire.</p>

<p>A spiral of insulated wire through which a current is
flowing shows all the properties of a magnet, and if free to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
move it comes to rest pointing north and south. It is
attracted or repelled by an ordinary magnet according to
the pole presented to it and the direction of the current,
and two such spirals show mutual attraction and repulsion.
A spiral of this kind is called a <em>solenoid</em>, and in addition
to the properties already mentioned it has the peculiar
power of drawing or sucking into its interior a rod of
iron. Solenoids have various practical applications, and in
later chapters we shall refer to them again.</p>

<p>If several turns of cotton-covered wire are wound round
an iron rod, the passing of a current through the wire
makes the rod into a magnet (<a href="#plate_IIa" class="pginternal">Plate II.<i>b</i></a>), but the magnetism
disappears as soon as the current ceases to flow. A
magnet made by the passage of an electric current is called
an <em>electro-magnet</em>, and it has all the properties of the
magnets mentioned in the previous chapter. A bar of steel
may be magnetized in the same way, but unlike the iron
rod it retains its magnetism after the current is interrupted.
This provides us with a means of magnetizing a piece of
steel much more strongly than is possible by rubbing with
another magnet. Steel magnets, which retain their
magnetism, are called <em>permanent</em> magnets, as distinguished
from electro-magnets in which soft iron is used, so
that their magnetism lasts only as long as the current
flows.</p>

<p>Electro-magnets play an extremely important part in
the harnessing of electricity; in fact they are used in one
form or another in almost every kind of electrical
mechanism. In later chapters many of these uses will be
described, and here we will mention only the use of
electro-magnets for lifting purposes. In large engineering
works powerful electro-magnets, suspended from some
sort of travelling crane, are most useful for picking up and
carrying about heavy masses of metal, such as large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
castings. No time is lost in attaching the casting to the
crane; the magnet picks it up directly the current is
switched on, and lets it go the instant the current is
stopped. In any large steel works the amount of scrap
material produced is astonishingly great, hundreds of tons
of turnings and similar scrap accumulating in a very short
time. A huge mound of turnings is awkward to deal with
by ordinary manual labour, but a combination of electro-magnet
and crane solves the difficulty completely, lifting
and loading the scrap into carts or trucks at considerable
speed, and without requiring much attention.</p>

<p>Some time ago a disastrous fire occurred at an
engineering works in the Midlands, the place being almost
entirely burnt out. Amongst the débris was, of course, a
large amount of metal, and as this was too valuable to be
wasted, an electro-magnet was set to work on the wreckage.
The larger pieces of metal were picked up in the ordinary
way, and then the remaining rubbish was shovelled against
the face of the magnet, which held on to the metal but
dropped everything else, and in this way some tons of
metal were recovered.</p>

<p>The effect produced upon a magnetized needle by a
current of electricity affords a simple means of detecting the
existence of such a current. An ordinary pocket compass
can be made to show the presence of a moderate current, but
for the detection of extremely small currents a much more
sensitive apparatus is employed. This is called a <em>galvanometer</em>,
and in its simplest form it consists essentially of
a delicately poised magnetic needle placed in the middle of
a coil of several turns of wire. The current thus passes
many times round the needle, and this has the effect of
greatly increasing the deflection of the needle, and hence
the sensitiveness of the instrument. Although such an
arrangement is generally called a galvanometer, it is really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
a galvanoscope, for it does not measure the current but only
shows its presence.</p>

<p>We have seen that electro-motive force is measured in
volts, and that the definition of a volt is that electro-motive
force which will cause a current of one ampere to flow
through a conductor having a resistance of one ohm. If we
make a galvanometer with a long coil of very thin wire
having a high resistance, the amount of current that will
flow through it will be proportionate to the electro-motive
force. Such a galvanometer, fitted with a carefully
graduated scale, in this way will indicate the number of
volts, and it is called a <em>voltmeter</em>. If we have a galvanometer
with a short coil of very thick wire, the resistance put
in the way of the current is so small that it may be left out
of account, and by means of a graduated scale the number
of amperes may be shown; such an instrument being called
an <em>amperemeter</em>, or <em>ammeter</em>.</p>

<p>For making exact measurements of electric currents the
instruments just described are not suitable, as they are not
sufficiently accurate; but their working shows the principle
upon which currents are measured. The actual instruments
used in electrical engineering and in scientific work are
unfortunately too complicated to be described here.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE INDUCTION COIL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> voltaic cell and the accumulator provide us with
currents of electricity of considerable volume, but at low
pressure or voltage. For many purposes, however, we require
a comparatively small amount of current at very high
pressure, and in such cases we use an apparatus called
the <em>induction coil</em>. Just as an electrified body and a
magnet will induce electrification and magnetism respectively,
so a current of electricity will induce another current;
and an induction coil is simply an arrangement by which a
current in one coil of wire is made to induce a current in
another coil.</p>

<p>Suppose we have two coils of wire placed close together,
one connected to a battery of voltaic cells, with
some arrangement for starting and stopping the current
suddenly, and the other to a galvanometer. As soon as
we send the current through the first coil, the needle of
the galvanometer moves, showing that there is a current
flowing through the second coil; but the needle quickly
comes back to its original position, showing that this
current was only momentary. So long as we keep the
current flowing through the first coil the galvanometer
shows no further movement, but as soon as we stop the
current the needle again shows by its movements that
another momentary current has been produced in the
second coil. This experiment shows us that a current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
induces another current only at the instant it is started or
stopped, or, as we say, at the instant of making or breaking
the circuit.</p>

<p>The coil through which we send the battery current is
called the “primary coil,” and the one in which a current is
induced is called the “secondary coil.” The two momentary
currents in the secondary coil do not both flow in the same
direction. The current induced on making the circuit
flows in a direction opposite to that of the current in the
primary coil; and the current induced on breaking the
circuit flows in the same direction as that in the primary
coil. If the two coils are exactly alike, the induced current
will have the same voltage as the primary current; but
if the secondary coil has twice as many turns of wire
as the primary coil, the induced current will have twice
the voltage of the primary current. In this way, by
multiplying the turns of wire in the secondary coil, we
can go on increasing the voltage of the induced current,
and this is the principle upon which the induction coil
works.</p>

<p>We may now describe the construction of such a coil.
The primary coil is made of a few turns of thick copper
wire carefully insulated, and inside it is placed a core consisting
of a bundle of separate wires of soft iron. Upon
this coil, but carefully insulated from it, is wound the
secondary coil, consisting of a great number of turns of
very fine wire. In large induction coils the secondary coil
has thousands of times as many turns as the primary, and
the wire forming it may be more than a hundred miles in
length. The ends of the secondary coil are brought to
terminals so that they can be connected up to any apparatus
as desired.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>—Diagram showing working of
Contact-Breaker for Induction Coil.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>In order that the induced currents shall follow each
other in quick succession, some means of rapidly making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and breaking the circuit is required, and this is provided
by an automatic contact breaker. It consists of a small
piece of soft iron, A, <a href="#fig_17" class="pginternal">Fig. 17</a>, fixed to a spring, B, having
a platinum tip at C. The adjustable screw, D, also has a
platinum tip, E. Normally the two platinum tips are just
touching one another, and matters are arranged so that
their contact completes the circuit. When the apparatus
is connected to a suitable battery a current flows through
the primary coil, and the iron core, F, becomes an electro-magnet,
which draws A towards it. The platinum tips
are thus no longer in contact and the circuit is broken.
Immediately this occurs the
iron core loses its magnetism
and ceases to attract A, which
is then moved back again by
the spring B, so that the
platinum tips touch, the circuit
is once more completed, and
the process begins over again.
All this takes place with the
utmost rapidity, and the speed
at which the contact-breaker
works is so great as to produce
a musical note. There
are many other types of contact-breakers, but in every
case the purpose is the same, namely, to make and
break the primary circuit as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the coil is greatly increased by a
condenser which is inserted in the primary circuit. It
consists of alternate layers of tinfoil and paraffined
paper, and its action is like that of a Leyden jar.
A switch is provided to turn the battery current on or
off, and there is also a reversing switch or commutator,
by means of which the direction of the current may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
reversed. The whole arrangement is mounted on a
suitable wooden base, and its general appearance is shown
in <a href="#fig_18" class="pginternal">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—Typical Induction Coil.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>By means of a large induction coil we can obtain a
voltage hundreds or even thousands of times greater than
that of the original battery current, but on account of the
great resistance of a very long, thin wire, the amperage is
much smaller. The induction coil produces a rapid
succession of sparks, similar to those obtained from a
Wimshurst machine. A coil has been constructed capable
of giving sparks 42½ inches in length, and having a
secondary coil with 340,000 turns of wire, the total
length of the wire being 280 miles. Induction coils are
largely employed for scientific purposes, and they are
used in wireless telegraphy and in the production of
X-rays.</p>

<p>The principle of the induction coil can be applied
also to the lowering of the voltage of a current. If
we make the secondary coil with less, instead of more
turns of wire than the primary coil, the induced current
will be of lower voltage than the primary current, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
its amperage will be correspondingly higher. This fact
is taken advantage of in cases where it is desirable
to transform a high voltage current from the public
mains down to a lower voltage current of greater
amperage.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DYNAMO AND THE ELECTRIC MOTOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Most</span> of my readers will have seen the small working
models of electric tramcars which can be bought at any
electrical supply stores. These usually require a current of
about one ampere at three or four volts. If we connect
such a car to the battery recommended for it, and keep it
running continuously, we find that the battery soon begins
to show signs of exhaustion. Now if we imagine our
little car increased to the size of an electric street car, and
further imagine, say, a hundred such cars carrying heavy
loads day after day from morning to night, we shall realize
that a battery of cells capable of supplying the current
necessary to run these cars would be so colossal as to be
utterly impracticable. We therefore must look beyond the
voltaic cell for a source of current for such a purpose, and
this source we find in a machine called the “dynamo,”
from the Greek word <em>dynamis</em>, meaning force.</p>

<p>Oersted’s discovery of the production of magnetism by
electricity naturally suggested the possibility of producing
electricity from magnetism. In the year 1831 one of the
most brilliant of our British scientists, Michael Faraday,
discovered that a current of electricity could be induced in
a coil of wire either by moving the coil towards or away
from a magnet, or by moving a magnet towards or away
from the coil. This may be shown in a simple way by
connecting the ends of a coil of insulated wire to a galvanometer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
and moving a bar magnet in and out of the coil;
when the galvanometer shows that a current is induced in
the coil on the insertion of the magnet, and again on its
withdrawal. We have seen that a magnet is surrounded
by a field of magnetic force, and Faraday found that the
current was induced when the lines of force were cut across.</p>

<p>Utilizing this discovery Faraday constructed the first
dynamo, which consisted of a copper plate or disc rotated
between the poles of a powerful horse-shoe magnet, so as
to cut the lines of force. The current flowed either from
the shaft to the rim, or <i lang="la">vice versa</i>, according to the direction
of rotation; and it was conducted away by means of two
wires with spring contacts, one pressing against the shaft,
and the other against the circumference of the disc. This
machine was miserably inefficient, but it was the very first
dynamo, and from it have been slowly evolved the mighty
dynamos used to-day in electric power stations throughout
the world. There is a little story told of Faraday
which is worth repeating even if it is not true. Speaking
of his discovery that a magnet could be made to produce
an electric current, a lady once said to him, “This is all
very interesting, but what is the use of it?” “Madam,”
replied Faraday, “what is the use of a baby?” In
Faraday’s “baby” dynamo, as in all others, some kind of
power must be used to produce the necessary motion, so
that all dynamos are really machines for converting
mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p>

<p>The copper disc in this first dynamo did not prove
satisfactory, and Faraday soon substituted for it rotating
coils of wire. In 1832 a dynamo was constructed in which
a length of insulated wire was wound upon two bobbins
having soft iron cores, and a powerful horse-shoe magnet
was fixed to a rotating spindle in such a position that its
poles faced the cores of the bobbins. This machine gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
a fair current, but it was found that the magnet gradually
lost its magnetism on account of the vibration caused by
its rotation. The next step was to make the magnet a
fixture, and to rotate the bobbins of wire. This was a
great improvement, and the power of machines built on
this principle was much increased by having a number of
rotating coils and several magnets. One such machine
had 64 separate
coils rotating
between the
poles of 40 large
magnets. Finally,
permanent
magnets were
superseded by
electro-magnets,
which
gave a much
more powerful
field of force.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>—Diagram showing principle of Dynamo
producing Alternating Current.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Having seen
something of
the underlying
principle and of
the history of
the dynamo, we
must turn our attention to its actual working. <a href="#fig_19" class="pginternal">Fig. 19</a> is a
rough representation of a dynamo in its simplest form. The
two poles of the magnet are shown marked north and south,
and between them revolves the coil of wire A¹ A², mounted
on a spindle SS. This revolving coil is called the armature.
To each of the insulated rings RR is fixed one end of the
coil, and BB are two brushes of copper or carbon, one
pressing on each ring. From these brushes the current is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
led away into the main circuit, and in this case we may
suppose that the current is used to light a lamp.</p>

<p>In speaking of the induction coil we saw that the
currents induced on making and on breaking the circuit
flowed in opposite directions, and similarly, Faraday found
that the currents induced in a coil of wire on inserting and
on withdrawing his magnet flowed in opposite directions.
In the present case the magnet is stationary and the coil
moves, but the effect is just the same. Now if we suppose
the armature to be revolving in a clockwise direction, then
A¹ is descending and entering the magnetic field in front of
the north pole, consequently a current is induced in the
coil, and of course in the main circuit also, in one direction.
Continuing its course, A¹ passes away from this portion of
the magnetic field, and thus a current is induced in the
opposite direction. In this way we get a current which
reverses its direction every half-revolution, and such a
current is called an alternating current. If, as in our
diagram, there are only two magnetic poles, the current
flows backwards and forwards once every revolution, but
by using a number of magnets, arranged so that the coil
passes in turn the poles of each, it can be made to flow
backwards and forwards several times. One complete
flow backwards and forwards is called a period, and the
number of periods per second is called the periodicity or
frequency of the current. A dynamo with one coil or set
of coils gives what is called “single-phase” current, that is, a
current having one wave which keeps flowing backwards
and forwards. If there are two distinct sets of coils we get
a two-phase current, in which there are two separate waves,
one rising as the other falls. Similarly, by using more
sets of coils, we may obtain three-phase or polyphase
currents.</p>

<p>Alternating current is unsuitable for certain purposes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
such as electroplating; and by making a small alteration in
our dynamo we get a continuous or direct current, which
does not reverse its direction. <a href="#fig_20" class="pginternal">Fig. 20</a> shows the new
arrangement. Instead of the two rings in <a href="#fig_19" class="pginternal">Fig. 19</a>, we have
now a single ring divided into two parts, each half being
connected to one end of the revolving coil. Each brush,
therefore, remains on one portion of the ring for half a
revolution, and
then passes
over on to the
other portion.
During one
half-revolution
we will suppose
the current to
be flowing from
brush B¹ in the
direction of the
lamp. Then
during the next
half-revolution
the current
flows in the opposite
direction;
but brush B¹
has passed on
to the other half
of the ring, and so the current is still leaving by it.
In this way the current must always flow in the same
direction in the main circuit, leaving by brush B¹ and
returning by brush B². This arrangement for making the
alternating current into a continuous current is called a
<em>commutator</em>.</p>

<p class="floatc">A TYPICAL DYNAMO AND ITS PARTS.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>In actual practice a dynamo has a set of electro-magnets,
and the armature consists of many coils of wire mounted
on a core of iron, which has the effect of concentrating the
lines of force. The armature generally revolves in small
dynamos, but in large ones it is usually a fixture, while the
electro-magnets revolve. <a href="#plate_IV" class="pginternal">Plate IV</a>. shows a typical dynamo
and its parts.</p>

<p>As we saw in an earlier chapter, an electro-magnet has
magnetic powers only while a current is being passed
through its winding, and so some means of supplying
current to the electro-magnets in a dynamo must be provided.
It is a remarkable fact that it is almost impossible
to obtain a piece of iron which has not some traces of
magnetism, and so when a dynamo is first set up there is
often sufficient magnetism in the iron of the electro-magnets
to produce a very weak field. The rapid cutting of the
feeble lines of force of this field sets up a weak current,
which, acting upon the electro-magnets, gradually brings
them up to full strength. Once the dynamo is generating
current it keeps on feeding its magnets by sending either
the whole or a part of its current through them. After
it has once been set going the dynamo is always able to
start again, because the magnet cores retain enough
magnetism to set up a weak field. If there is not enough
magnetism in the cores to start a dynamo for the first
time, a current from some outside source is sent round the
magnets.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks apply to continuous current
dynamos only. Alternating current can be used for exciting
electro-magnets, but in this case the magnetic field produced
is alternating also, so that each pole of the magnet has
north and south magnetism alternately. This will not do
for dynamo field magnets, and therefore an alternating
current dynamo cannot feed its own magnets. The electro-magnets
in such dynamos are supplied with current from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
separate continuous current dynamo, which may be of quite
small size.</p>

<p>It is a very interesting fact that electric current can
be generated by a dynamo in which the earth itself is
used to provide the magnetic field, no permanent or electro-magnets
being used at all. A simple form of dynamo
of this kind consists of a rectangular loop of copper wire
rotating about an axis pointing east and west, so that
the loop cuts the lines of force of the Earth’s magnetic
field.</p>

<p>The dynamo provides us with a constant supply of
electric current, but this current is no use unless we can
make it do work for us. If we reverse the usual order of
things in regard to a dynamo, and supply the machine with
current instead of mechanical power, we find that the
armature begins to revolve rapidly, and the machine is
no longer a dynamo, but has become an electric motor.
This shows us that an electric motor is simply a dynamo
reversed. Let us suppose that we wish to use the
dynamo in <a href="#fig_20" class="pginternal">Fig. 20</a> as a motor. In order to supply the
current we will take away the lamp and substitute a
second continuous-current dynamo. We know from
<a href="#chapter_VII" class="pginternal">Chapter VII</a>. that when a current is sent through a coil
of wire the coil becomes a magnet with a north and a
south pole. The coil in our dynamo becomes a magnet
as soon as the current is switched on, and the attraction
between its poles and the opposite poles of the magnet
causes it to make half a revolution. At this point the
commutator reverses the current, and consequently the
polarity of the coil, so that there is now repulsion where
previously there was attraction, and the coil makes another
half-revolution. So the process goes on until the armature
attains a very high speed. In general construction there is
practically no difference between a dynamo and a motor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
but there are differences in detail which adapt each to its
own particular work. By making certain alterations in
their construction electric motors can be run with alternating
current.</p>

<p>The fact that a dynamo could be reversed and run as a
motor was known probably as early as 1838, but the great
value of this reversibility does not seem to have been
realized until 1873. At an industrial exhibition held at
Vienna in that year, it so happened that a workman or
machinery attendant connected two cables to a dynamo
which was standing idle, and he was much surprised to
find that it at once began to revolve at a great speed. It
was then seen that the cables led to another dynamo which
was running, and that the current from this source had
made the first dynamo into a motor. There are many
versions of this story, but the important point in all
is that this was the first occasion on which general
attention was drawn to the possibilities of the electric
motor.</p>

<p>The practical advantages afforded by the electric motor
are many and great. Once we have installed a sufficiently
powerful dynamo and a steam or other engine to drive it,
we can place motors just where they are required, either
close to the dynamo or miles away, driving them simply by
means of a connecting cable. In factories, motors can be
placed close to the machines they are required to drive,
anywhere in the building, thus doing away with all complicated
and dangerous systems of shafting and belts. In
many cases where it would be either utterly impossible or
at least extremely inconvenient to use any form of steam,
gas, or oil engine, electric motors can be employed without
the slightest difficulty. In order to realize this, one only
has to think of the positions in which electrically-driven
ventilating fans are placed, or of the unpleasantly familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
electric drill of the dentist. An electric motor is small and
compact, gives off no fumes and practically no heat, makes
very little noise, is capable of running for very long periods
at high speed and with the utmost steadiness, and requires
extremely little attention.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRIC POWER STATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> is apparently a very simple matter to fit up a power
station with a number of very large dynamos driven by
powerful engines, and to distribute the current produced by
these dynamos to all parts of a town or district by means
of cables, but as a matter of fact it is a fairly complicated
engineering problem. First of all the source of power for
driving the dynamos has to be considered. In private and
other small power plants, gas, petrol or oil engines are
generally used, but for large stations the choice lies between
steam and water power. In this country steam power is
used almost exclusively. Formerly the ordinary reciprocating
steam engines were always employed, and though these
are still in very extensive use, they are being superseded in
many cases by steam turbines. The turbine is capable of
running at higher speeds than the reciprocating engine, and
at the greatest speeds it runs with a great deal less noise,
and with practically no vibration at all. More than this,
turbines take up much less room, and require less oil and
attendance. The turbines are coupled directly to the
dynamos, so that the two machines appear almost as one.
In the power station shown on <a href="#plate_V" class="pginternal">Plate V</a>. a number of alternating
current dynamos coupled to steam turbines are seen.</p>

<p>A large power station consumes enormous quantities of
coal, and for convenience of supply it is situated on the
bank of a river or canal, or, if neither of these is available,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
as close to the railway as possible. The unloading of the
coal barges or trucks is done mechanically, the coal passing
into a large receiving hopper. From here it is taken to
another hopper close to the furnaces by means of coal
elevators and conveyors, which consist of a number of
buckets fixed at short intervals on an endless travelling
chain. From the furnace hopper the coal is fed into the
furnaces by mechanical stokers, and the resulting ash and
clinker falls into a pit below the furnaces, from which it is
carted away.</p>

<p>The heat produced in the furnaces is used to generate
steam, and from the boilers the steam passes to the engines
along a steam pipe. After doing its work in the engines,
the steam generally passes to a condenser, in which it is
cooled to water, freed from oil and grease, and returned to
the boilers to be transformed once more into steam. As
this water from the condenser is quite warm, less heat is
required to raise steam from it than would be the case if
the boiler supply were kept up with cold water. The
power generated by the engines is used to drive the
dynamos, and stout copper cables convey the current from
these to what are called “bus” bars. There are two of
these, one receiving the positive cable from the dynamos,
and the other the negative cable, and the bars run from end
to end of a large main switchboard. From this switchboard
the current is distributed by other cables known as feeders.</p>

<p>The nature of the current generated at a power station
is determined to a great extent by the size of the district to
be supplied. Generally speaking, where the current is not
to be transmitted beyond a radius of about two miles from
the station, continuous current is generated; while alternating
current is employed for the supply of larger areas. In
some cases both kinds of current are generated at one
station.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;" id="plate_V">
  <p class="caption">PLATE V.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>If continuous current is to be used, it is generated
usually at a pressure of from 400 to 500 volts, the average
being about 440 volts; and the supply is generally on what
is known as the three-wire system. Three separate wires
are employed. The two outer wires are connected
respectively to the positive and the negative bus bars
running along the main switchboard, these bars receiving
positive or negative current directly from the dynamos.
The outer wires therefore carry current at the full voltage
of the system. Between them is a third and smaller wire,
connected to a third bar, much smaller than the outer bars,
and known as the mid-wire bar. This bar is not connected
to the dynamos, but to earth, by means of a large plate of
copper sunk into the ground. Connexion between the
mid-wire bar and the outer bars is made by two machines
called “balancers,” one connecting the mid-wire bar and the
positive bus bar, and the other the mid-wire bar and the
negative bus bar. If the pressure between the outer bars
is 440 volts, then the pressure between the mid-wire bar and
either of the outer bars will be 220 volts, that is just half.</p>

<p>The balancers serve the purpose of balancing the
voltage on each side, and they are machines capable of
acting either as motors or dynamos. In order to comply
with Board of Trade regulations, electric appliances of all
kinds intended for ordinary domestic purposes, including
lamps, and heating and cooking apparatus, are supplied
with current at a pressure not exceeding 250 volts. In a
system such as we are describing, all these appliances are
connected between the mid-wire and one or other of the
outer wires, thus receiving current at 220 volts. In
practice it is impossible to arrange matters so that the
lamps and other appliances connected with the positive side
of the system shall always take the same amount of current
as those connected with the negative side, and there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
always liable to be a much greater load on one side or the
other. If, for instance, a heavy load is thrown on the
negative side, the voltage on that side will drop. The
balancer on the positive side then acts as an electric motor,
drives the balancer on the negative side as a dynamo, and
thus provides the current required to raise the voltage on
the negative side until the balance is restored. The working
of the balancers, which need not be described in further
detail, is practically automatic. Electric motors, for driving
electric trams or machinery of any kind, are connected
between the outer wires, so that they receive the full 440
volts of the system.</p>

<p>In any electric supply system the demand for current
does not remain constant, but fluctuates more or less. For
instance, in a system including an electric tramway, if a car
breaks down and remains a fixture for a short time, all cars
behind it are held up, and a long line of cars is quickly
formed. When the breakdown is repaired, all the cars
start practically at the same instant, and consequently a
sudden and tremendous demand for current is made. In a
very large tramway system in a fairly level city, the
fluctuations in the demand for current, apart from accidents,
are not very serious, for they tend to average themselves;
but in a small system, and particularly if the district is hilly,
the fluctuations are very great, and the current demand
may vary as much as from 400 to 2000 amperes. Again,
in a system supplying power and light, the current demand
rises rapidly as the daylight fails on winter afternoons,
because, while workshop and other motors are still in full
swing, thousands of electric lamps are switched on more or
less at the same time. The power station must be able to
deal with any exceptional demands which are likely to
occur, and consequently more current must be available
than is actually required under average conditions. Instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of having generating machinery large enough to meet all
unusual demands, the generators at a station using continuous
current may be only of sufficient size to supply a little
more than the average demand, any current beyond this
being supplied by a battery of storage cells. The battery
is charged during periods when the demand for current is
small, and when a heavy load comes on, the current from
the battery relieves the generators of the sudden strain.
To be of any service for such a purpose the storage battery
of course must be very large. <a href="#plate_VI" class="pginternal">Plate VI</a>. shows a large
battery of no cells, and some idea of the size of the
individual cells may be obtained from the fact that each
weighs about 3900 lb.</p>

<p>Alternating current is produced at almost all power
stations supplying large districts. It is generated at high
pressure, from 2000 volts upwards, the highest pressure
employed in this country being about 11,000 volts. Such
pressures are of course very much too high for electric
lamps or motors, and the object of generating current of
this kind is to secure the greatest economy in transmission
through the long cables. Electric energy is measured in
watts, the watts being obtained by multiplying together
the pressure or voltage of the current, and its rate of flow
or amperage. From this it will be seen that, providing the
product of voltage and amperage remains the same, it
makes no difference, so far as electric energy is concerned,
whether the current be of high voltage and low amperage,
or of low voltage and high amperage. Now in transmitting
a current through a long cable, there is a certain
amount of loss due to the heating of the conductor. This
heating is caused by the current flow, not by the pressure;
and the heavier the current, the greater the heating, and
the greater the loss. This being so, it is clear that by
decreasing the current flow, and correspondingly increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the pressure, the loss in transmission will be reduced; and
this is why alternating current is generated at high pressure
when it is to be transmitted to a distance.</p>

<p>The kind of alternating current generated is usually
that known as three-phase current. Formerly single-phase
current was in general use, but it has been superseded by
three-phase current because the latter is more economical
to generate and to distribute, and also more satisfactory for
electric motors. The actual voltage of the current sent out
from the station varies according to the distance to which
the current is to be conveyed. In the United States and
in other countries where current has to be conveyed to
places a hundred or even more miles from the station,
pressures as high as 120,000 volts are in use. It is possible
to produce alternating current at such pressures directly
from the dynamos, but in practice this is never done, on
account of the great liability to breakdown of the insulation.
Instead, the current is generated at from 2000 to 10,000 or
11,000 volts, and raised to the required pressure, before
leaving the station, by means of a step-up transformer.
We have seen that an induction coil raises, or steps up, the
voltage of the current supplied to it. A step-up transformer
works on the same principle as the induction coil, and in
passing through it the current is raised in voltage, but
correspondingly lowered in amperage. Of course, if the
pressure of the current generated by the dynamos is already
sufficiently high to meet the local requirements, the transformer
is not used.</p>

<p>For town supply the current from the power station is
led along underground cables to a number of sub-stations,
situated in different parts of the town, and generally underground.
At each sub-station the current passes through a
step-down transformer, which also acts on the principle of the
induction coil, but in the reverse way, so that the voltage is
lowered instead of being raised. From the transformer the
current emerges at the pressure required for use, but it is
still alternating current; and if it is desired to have a
continuous-current supply this alternating current must be
converted. One of the simplest arrangements for this
purpose consists of an electric motor and a dynamo, the
two being coupled together. The motor is constructed to
run on the alternating current from the transformer, and
it drives the dynamo, which is arranged to generate continuous
current. There is also a machine called a “rotary
converter,” which is largely used instead of the motor
generator. This machine does the work of both motor and
dynamo, but its action is too complicated to be described
here. From the sub-stations the current, whether converted
or not, is distributed as required by a network of
underground cables.</p>

<p>In many parts of the world, especially in America,
water power is utilized to a considerable extent instead of
steam for the generation of electric current. The immense
volume of water passing over the Falls of Niagara develops
energy equal to about seven million horse-power, and a
small amount of this energy, roughly about three-quarters
of a million horse-power, has been harnessed and made to
produce electric current for light and power. The water
passes down a number of penstocks, which are tubes or
tunnels about 7 feet in diameter, lined with brick and
concrete; and at the bottom of these tubes are placed
powerful water turbines. The falling water presses upon
the vanes of the turbines, setting them revolving at great
speed, and the power produced in this way is used to drive
a series of very large alternating current dynamos. The
current is conveyed at a pressure of about 60,000 volts
to various towns within a radius of 200 or 300 miles,
and it is anticipated that before very long the supply will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
be extended to towns still more distant. Many other
American rivers have been harnessed in a similar way,
though not to the same extent; and Switzerland and
Norway are utilizing their water power on a rapidly
increasing scale. In England, owing to the abundance of
coal, little has been done in this direction. Scotland is
well favoured in the matter of water power, and it is
estimated that the total power available is considerably
more than enough to run the whole of the railways of that
country. Very little of this power has been utilized however,
and the only large hydro-electric installation is the
one at Kinlochleven, in Argyllshire. It is a mistake to
suppose that water power means power for nothing, but
taking things all round the cost of water power is considerably
lower than that of steam.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> electric tramcar has become such a necessary feature
of our everyday life that it is very difficult to realize how
short a time it has been with us. To most of us a horse-drawn
tramcar looks like a relic of prehistoric times, and
yet it is not so many years since the horse tram was in full
possession of our streets. Strikes of tramway employees
are fortunately rare events, but a few have occurred during
the past two or three years in Leeds and in other towns,
and they have brought home to us our great dependence
upon the electric tram. During the Leeds strike the streets
presented a most curious appearance, and the city seemed
to have made a jump backward to fifty years ago. Every
available article on wheels was pressed into service to bring
business men into the city from the outlying districts, and
many worthy citizens were seen trying to look dignified
and unconcerned as they jogged along in conveyances
which might have come out of the Ark. On such an
occasion as this, if we imagine the electric light supply
stopped also, we can form some little idea of our indebtedness
to those who have harnessed electricity and made it
the greatest power of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>There are three distinct electric tramway systems; the
trolley or overhead system, the surface contact system,
and the conduit system. The trolley system has almost
driven the other two from the field, and it is used almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
exclusively throughout Great Britain and Ireland. On the
Continent and in the United States the conduit system still
survives, but probably it will not be long before the trolley
system is universally employed.</p>

<p>The superiority of the trolley system lies in the fact that
it is cheaper to construct and to maintain than the other
two, and also in its much greater reliability under all
working conditions. The overhead wire is not one continuous
cable, but is divided into sections of about half a
mile in length, each section being supplied with current
from a separate main. At each point where the current
is fed to the trolley wire a sort of metal box may be seen
at the side of the street. These boxes are called “feeder
pillars,” and each contains a switch by means of which the
current can be cut off from that particular section, for
repairing or other purposes. Above the car is fixed an arm
provided with a trolley wheel which runs along the wire,
and this wheel takes the current from the wire. From the
wheel the current passes down the trolley arm to the
controller, which is operated by the driver, and from there
to the motors beneath the car. Leaving the motors it
passes to the wheels and then to the rails, from which it
is led off at intervals by cables and so returned to the
generating station. The current carried by the rails is at
a pressure of only a few volts, so that there is not the
slightest danger of shock from them. There are generally
two electric motors beneath the car, and the horse-power
of each varies from about fifteen to twenty-five.</p>

<p>The controller consists mainly of a number of graduated
resistances. To start the car the driver moves a handle
forward notch by notch, thus gradually cutting out the
resistance, and so the motors receive more and more
current until they are running at full speed. The movement
of the controller handle also alters the connexion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the motors. When the car is started the motors are
connected in series, so that the full current passes through
each, while the pressure is divided between them; but
when the car is well on the move the controller connects
the motors in parallel, so that each receives the full pressure
of the current.</p>

<p>The conduit and surface contact systems are much the
same as the trolley system except in the method of supplying
the current to the cars. In the conduit system two
conductors conveying the current are placed in an underground
channel or conduit of concrete strengthened by iron
yokes. The top of the conduit is almost closed in so as to
leave only a narrow slot, through which passes the current
collector of the car. This current collector, or “plough” as
it is called, carries two slippers which make contact with the
conductors, and thus take current from them. In this
system the current returns along one of the conductors, so
that no current passes along the track rails. This is the
most expensive of the three systems, both in construction
and maintenance.</p>

<p>The surface contact or stud system is like the conduit
system in having conductors placed in a sort of underground
trough, but in this case contact with the conductors
is made by means of metal studs fixed at intervals in the
middle of the track. The studs are really the tops of
underground boxes each containing a switch, which, when
drawn up to a certain position, connects the stud to the
conductors. These switches are arranged to be moved by
magnets fixed beneath the car, and thus when the car
passes over a stud the magnets work the switch and connect
the stud to the conductors, so that the stud is then
“alive.” The current is taken from the studs by means of
sliding brushes or skates which are carried by the car.
The studs are thus alive only when the car is passing over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
them, and at all other times they are dead, and not in any
way dangerous.</p>

<p>The weight and speed of electric cars make it important
to have a thoroughly reliable system of brakes. First of
all there are ordinary mechanical brakes, which press
against the wheels. Then there are electro-magnetic
slipper brakes which press on the rails instead of on the
wheels of the car. These brakes are operated by electro-magnets
of great power, the current necessary to excite the
magnets being taken from the motors. Finally there is
a most interesting and ingenious method of regenerative
control. Before a car can be stopped after it has attained
considerable speed a certain amount of energy has to be
got rid of in some way. With the ordinary mechanical or
electro-magnetic brakes this energy is wasted, but in the
regenerative method it is turned into electric current, which
is sent back into the circuit. If an electric motor is supplied
with mechanical power instead of electric current it becomes
a dynamo, and generates current instead of using it. In
the regenerative system, when a car is “coasting” down a
hill it drives the wheels, and the wheels drive the motors,
so that the latter become dynamos and generate current
which is sent back to the power station. In this way some
of the abnormal amount of current taken by a car in climbing
a hill is returned when the car descends the hill. The
regenerative system limits the speed of the car, so that it

<p>A large tramway system spreads outwards from the
centre of a city to the suburbs, and usually terminates at
various points on the outskirts of these suburbs. It often
happens that there are villages lying some distance beyond
these terminal points, and it is very desirable that there
should be some means of transport between these villages
and the city. An extension of the existing tramway is not
practicable in many cases, because the traffic would not be
sufficient to pay for the heavy outlay, and also because the
road may not be of sufficient width to admit of cars running
on a fixed track. The difficulty may be overcome satisfactorily
by the use of trackless trolley cars. With these
cars the costly business of laying a rail track is altogether
avoided, only a system of overhead wires being necessary.
As there is no rail to take the return current, a second
overhead wire is required. The car is fitted with two
trolley arms, and the current is taken from one wire by the
first arm, sent through the controller and the motors, and
returned by the second arm to the other wire, and so back
to the generating station. The trolley poles are so arranged
that they allow the car to be steered round obstructions
or slow traffic, and the car wheels are usually fitted
with solid rubber tyres. Trackless cars are not capable of
dealing with a large traffic, but they are specially suitable
where an infrequent service, say a half-hourly one, is enough
to meet requirements.</p>

<p>We come now to electric railways. These may be
divided into two classes, those with separate locomotives
and those without. The separate locomotive method is
largely used for haulage purposes in collieries and large
works of various kinds. In <a href="#plate_VII" class="pginternal">Plate VII</a>. is seen an electric
locomotive hauling a train of coal waggons in a colliery
near the Tyne, and it will be seen that the overhead
system is used, the trolley arm and wheel being replaced
by sliding bows. In a colliery railway it is generally
impossible to select the most favourable track from the
railway constructor’s point of view, as the line must be
arranged to serve certain points. This often means taking
the line sometimes through low tunnels or bridges where
the overhead wire must be low, and sometimes over public
roads where the wire must be high; and the sliding bow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
is better able than the trolley arm and wheel to adapt
itself to these variations. In the colliery where this locomotive
is used the height of the overhead wire ranges
from 10 feet 6 inches through tunnels or bridges, to 21 feet
where the public road is crossed. The locomotive weighs
33½ tons, and has four electric motors each developing
50 horse-power with the current employed. It will be
noticed that the locomotive has two sets of buffers. This
is because it has to deal with both main line waggons and
the smaller colliery waggons, the upper set of buffers being
for the former, and the lower and narrower set for the
latter. <a href="#plate_VIII" class="pginternal">Plate VIII</a>. shows a 50-ton locomotive on the
British Columbia Electric Railway, and a powerful locomotive
in use in South America. In each case it will be
seen that the trolley wheel is used.</p>

<p>In this country electric railways for passenger traffic
are mostly worked on what is known as the multiple-unit
system, in which no separate locomotives are used, the
motors and driving mechanism being placed on the cars
themselves. There are also other cars without this equipment,
so that a train consists of a single motor-car with or
without trailer, or of two motor-cars with trailer between,
or in fact of any other combination. When a train
contains two or more motor-cars all the controllers, which
are very similar to those on electric tramcars, are electrically
connected so as to be worked together from one
master controller. This system allows the length of the
train to be adjusted to the number of passengers, so that
no power is wasted in running empty cars during periods
of small traffic. In suburban railways, where the stopping-places
are many and close together, the efficiency of the
service depends to a large extent upon the time occupied
in bringing the trains from rest to full speed. In this
respect the electric train has a great advantage over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
ordinary train hauled by a steam locomotive, for it can
pick up speed at three or more times the rate of the latter,
thus enabling greater average speeds and a more frequent
service to be maintained.</p>

<p>Electric trains are supplied with current from a central
generating station, just as in the case of electric tramcars,
but on passenger lines the overhead wire is in most cases
replaced by a third rail. This live rail is placed upon
insulators just outside the track rail, and the current is
collected from it by sliding metal slippers which are carried
by the cars. The return current may pass along the
track rails as in the case of trolley tramcars, or be conveyed
by another insulated conducting rail running along
the middle of the track.</p>

<p>The electric railways already described are run on continuous
current, but there are also railways run on alternating
current. A section of the London, Brighton, and South
Coast Railway is electrically operated by alternating
current, the kind of current used being that known as
single-phase. The overhead system is used, and the
current is led to the wire at a pressure of about 6000 volts.
This current is collected by sliding bows and conveyed to
transformers carried on the trains, from which it emerges
at a pressure of about 300 volts, and is then sent through
the motors. The overhead wires are not fixed directly to
the supports as in the case of overhead tramway wires, but
instead two steel cables are carried by the supports, and
the live wires are hung from these. The effect of this
arrangement is to make the sliding bows run steadily and
evenly along the wires without jumping or jolting. If ever
electricity takes the place of steam for long distance railway
traffic, this system, or some modification of it, probably
will be employed.</p>

<p>Mention must be made also of the Kearney high speed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
electric mono-railway. In this system the cars, which are
electrically driven, are fitted above and below with grooved
wheels. The lower wheels run on a single central rail
fixed to sleepers resting on the ground, and the upper
wheels run on an overhead guide rail. It is claimed that
speeds of 150 miles an hour are attainable with safety and
economy in working. This system is yet only just out of
the experimental stage, but its working appears to be
exceedingly satisfactory.</p>

<p>A self-contained electric locomotive has been constructed
by the North British Locomotive Company. It
is fitted with a steam turbine which drives a dynamo generating
continuous current, and the current is used to drive
four electric motors. This locomotive has undergone extensive
trials, but its practical value as compared with the
ordinary type of electric locomotive supplied with current
from an outside source is not yet definitely established.</p>

<p>At first sight it appears as though the electric storage
cell or accumulator ought to provide an almost perfect
means of supplying power for self-propelled electric vehicles
of all kinds. In practice, however, it has been found that
against the advantages of the accumulator there are to be
set certain great drawbacks, which have not yet been
overcome. Many attempts have been made to apply
accumulator traction to electric tramway systems, but they
have all failed, and the idea has been abandoned. There
are many reasons for the failure of these attempts. The
weight of a battery of accumulators large enough to run a
car with a load of passengers is tremendous, and this is
of course so much dead weight to be hauled along, and it
becomes a very serious matter when steep hills have to be
negotiated. When a car is started on a steep up-gradient
a sudden and heavy demand for current is made, and this
puts upon the accumulators a strain which they are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
able to bear without injury. Another great drawback is
the comparatively short time for which accumulators can
give a heavy current, for this necessitates the frequent
return of the cars to the central station in order to have
the batteries re-charged. Finally, accumulators are sensitive
things, and the continuous heavy vibration of a tramcar
is ruinous to them.</p>

<p>The application of accumulators to automobiles is much
more feasible, and within certain limits the electric motor-car
may be considered a practical success. The electric
automobile is superior to the petrol-driven car in its delightfully
easy and silent running, and its freedom from all
objectionable smells. On the other hand high speeds
cannot be attained, and there is the trouble of having the
accumulators re-charged, but for city work this is not a
serious matter. Two sets of accumulators are used, so that
one can be left at the garage to be charged while the other
is in use, the replacing of the exhausted set by the freshly
charged one being a matter of only a few minutes. The
petrol-driven car is undoubtedly superior in every way for
touring purposes. Petrol can now be obtained practically
anywhere, whereas accumulator charging stations are comparatively
few and far between, especially in country
districts; and there is no comparison as regards convenience
between the filling of a petrol tank and the charging of a
set of accumulators, for one process takes a few minutes
and the other a few hours.</p>

<p>Accumulator-driven locomotives are not in general use,
but for certain special purposes they have proved very
satisfactory. A large locomotive of this kind was used for
removing excavated material and for taking in the iron
segments, sleepers, rails, and other materials in the construction
of the Great Northern, Piccadilly, and Brompton
Tube Railway. This locomotive is 50 feet 6 inches long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and it carries a battery of eighty large “chloride” cells, the
total weight of locomotive and battery being about 64
tons. It is capable of hauling a load of 60 tons at a
rate of from 7 to 9 miles an hour on the level.</p>

<p>Amongst the latest developments of accumulator traction
is a complete train to take the place of a steam locomotive
hauling a single coach on the United Railways of Cuba.
According to the <cite>Scientific American</cite> the train consists
of three cars, each having a battery of 216 cells, supplying
current at 200 volts to the motors. Each car has accommodation
for forty-two passengers, and the three are arranged
to work on the multiple-unit system from one master controller.
The batteries will run from 60 to 100 miles for
each charging of seven hours.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRIC LIGHTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the first year of the nineteenth century one of the
greatest of England’s scientists, Sir Humphry Davy,
became lecturer on chemistry to the Royal Institution,
where his brilliant lectures attracted large and enthusiastic
audiences. He was an indefatigable experimenter, and in
order to help on his work the Institution placed at his
disposal a very large voltaic battery consisting of 2000
cells. In 1802 he found that if two rods of carbon, one
connected to each terminal of his great battery, were
first made to touch one another and then gradually
separated, a brilliant arch of light was formed between
them. The intense brilliance of this electric arch, or <em>arc</em>
as it came to be called, naturally suggested the possibility
of utilizing Davy’s discovery for lighting purposes, but the
maintaining of the necessary current proved a serious
obstacle. The first cost of a battery of the required size
was considerable, but this was a small matter compared
with the expense of keeping the cells in good working
order. Several very ingenious and more or less efficient
arc lamps fed by battery current were produced by various
inventors, but for the above reason they were of little use
except for experimental purposes, and the commercial
success of the arc lamp was an impossibility until the
dynamo came to be a really reliable source of current.
Since that time innumerable shapes and forms of arc lamps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
have been devised, while the use of such lamps has increased
by leaps and bounds. To-day, wherever artificial
illumination on a large scale is required, there the arc lamp
is to be found.</p>

<p>When the carbon rods are brought into contact and
then slightly separated, a spark passes between them.
Particles of carbon are torn off by the spark and volatilized,
and these incandescent particles form a sort of bridge which
is a sufficiently good conductor for the current to pass
across it from one rod to the other. When the carbons
are placed horizontally, the glowing mass is carried upwards
by the ascending currents of heated air, and it assumes the
arch-like form from which it gets its name. If the carbons
are vertical the curve is not produced, a more or less
straight line being formed instead. The electric arc may be
formed between any conducting substances, but for practical
lighting purposes carbon is found to be most suitable.</p>

<p>Either continuous or alternating currents may be used
to form the arc. With continuous current, if the carbon
rods are fully exposed to the air, they gradually consume
away, and minute particles of carbon are carried across
from the positive rod to the negative rod, so that the former
wastes at about twice the rate of the latter. The end of
the positive rod becomes hollowed out so as to resemble a
little crater, and the end of the negative rod becomes more
or less pointed. The fact that with continuous current the
positive rod consumes away twice as fast as the negative
rod, may be taken advantage of to decrease the cost of new
carbons, by replacing the wasted positive rod with a new
one, and using the unconsumed portion of the old positive
rod as a new negative rod.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">1</a> If alternating current is used,
each rod in turn becomes the positive rod, so that no crater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
is formed, and both the carbons have the same shape and
are consumed at the same rate. A humming noise is liable
to be produced by the alternating current arc, but by careful
construction of the lamp this noise is reduced to the
minimum.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_1" id="Footnote_1">1</a> In actual practice the positive carbon is made double the thickness of the
negative, so that the two consume at about the same rate.</p>

</div>

<p>If the carbons are enclosed in a suitable globe the
rate of wasting is very much less. The oxygen inside the
globe becomes rapidly consumed, and although the globe
is not air-tight, the heated gases produced inside it check
the entrance of further supplies of fresh air as long as the
lamp is kept burning. When the light is extinguished,
and the lamp cools down, fresh air enters again freely.</p>

<p>Arc lamp carbons may be either solid or cored. The
solid form is made entirely of very hard carbon, while the
cored form consists of a narrow tube of carbon filled up with
soft graphite. Cored carbons usually burn more steadily
than the solid form. In what are known as flame arc
lamps the carbons are impregnated with certain metallic
salts, such as calcium. These lamps give more light for
the same amount of current. The arc is long and flame-like,
and usually of a striking yellow colour, but it is not so
steady as the ordinary arc.</p>

<figure class="figright" style="max-width: 13em;" id="fig_21">

  <figcaption class="caption hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>—Diagram showing simple
method of carbon regulation for Arc Lamps.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>As the carbon rods waste away, the length of the arc
increases, and if this increase goes beyond a certain limit
the arc breaks and the current ceases. If the arc is to be
kept going for any length of time some arrangement for
pushing the rods closer together must be provided, in order
to counteract the waste. In arc lamps this pushing together,
or “feeding” as it is called, is done automatically, as
is also the first bringing together and separating of the rods
to start or strike the arc. <a href="#fig_21" class="pginternal">Fig. 21</a> shows a simple arrangement
for this purpose. A is the positive carbon, and B
the negative. C is the holder for the positive carbon, and
this is connected to the rod D, which is made of soft iron.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
This rod is wound with two separate coils of wire as shown,
coil E having a low resistance, and coil F a high one.
These two coils are solenoids, and D is the core,
(<a href="#chapter_VII" class="pginternal">Chapter VII</a>.). When the lamp is not in use, the weight of
the holder keeps the positive carbon in contact with the
negative carbon. When switched on, the current flows
along the cable to the point H. Here it has two paths
open to it, one through coil E to the positive carbon, and
the other through coil F and back to the source of supply.
But coil E has a much lower
resistance than coil F, and
so most of the current
chooses the easier path
through E, only a small
amount of current taking
the path through the other
coil. Both coils are now
magnetized, and E tends to
draw the rod D upwards,
while F tends to pull it
downwards. Coil E, however,
has much greater power
than coil F, because a much
larger amount of current is
passing through it; and so it overcomes the feeble pull of F,
and draws up the rod. The raising of D lifts the positive
carbon away from the negative carbon, and the arc is struck.
The carbons now begin to waste away, and very slowly the
distance between them increases. The path of the current
passing through coil E is from carbon A to carbon B by
way of the arc, and as the length of the gap between A
and B increases, the resistance of this path also increases.
The way through coil E thus becomes less easy, and as
time goes on more and more current takes the alternative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
path through coil F. This results in a decrease in the
magnetism of E, and an increase in that of F, and at a
certain point F becomes the more powerful of the two, and
pulls down the rod. In this way the positive carbon is
lowered and brought nearer to the negative carbon.
Directly the diminishing distance between A and B reaches
a certain limit, coil E once more asserts its superiority, and
by overcoming the pull of F it stops the further approach
of the carbons. So, by the opposing forces of the two
coils, the carbons are maintained between safe limits, in
spite of their wasting away.</p>

<p class="floatc">NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS, TAKEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMPS.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The arc lamp is largely used for the illumination
of wide streets, public squares, railway stations, and the
exteriors of theatres, music-halls, picture houses, and large
shops. The intense brilliancy of the light produced may be
judged from the accompanying photographs (<a href="#plate_IXa" class="pginternal">Plate IX</a>.),
which were taken entirely by the light of the arc lamps.
Still more powerful arc lamps are constructed for use in
lighthouses. The illuminating power of some of these
lamps is equal to that of hundreds of thousands of
candles, and the light, concentrated by large reflectors, is
visible at distances varying from thirty to one hundred
miles.</p>

<p>Arc lamps are also largely used for lighting interiors,
such as large showrooms, factories or workshops. For
this kind of lighting the dazzling glare of the outdoor
lamp would be very objectionable and harmful to the eyes,
so methods of indirect lighting are employed to give a soft
and pleasant light. Most of the light in the arc lamp comes
from the positive carbon, and for ordinary outdoor lighting
this carbon is placed above the negative carbon. In lamps
for interior lighting the arrangement is frequently reversed,
so that the positive carbon is below. Most of the light is
thus directed upwards, and if the ceiling is fairly low and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of a white colour the rays are reflected by it, and a soft and
evenly diffused lighting is the result. Some light comes
also from the negative carbon, and those downward rays
are reflected to the ceiling by a reflector placed beneath the
lamp. Where the ceiling is very high or of an unsuitable
colour, a sort of artificial ceiling in the shape of a large
white reflector is placed above the lamp to produce the
same effect. Sometimes the lamp is arranged so that part
of the light is reflected to the ceiling, and part transmitted
directly through a semi-transparent reflector below the
lamp. The composition of the light of the arc lamp is very
similar to that of sunlight, and by the use of such lamps the
well-known difficulty of judging and matching colours by
artificial light is greatly reduced. This fact is of great
value in drapery establishments, and the arc lamp has
proved a great success for lighting rooms used for night
painting classes.</p>

<p>The powerful searchlights used by warships are arc
lamps provided with special arrangements for projecting
the light in any direction. A reflector behind the arc concentrates
the light and sends it out as a bundle of parallel
rays, and the illuminating power is such that a good searchlight
has a working range of nearly two miles in clear
weather. According to the size of the projector, the
illumination varies from about 3000 to 30,000 or 40,000
candle-power. For some purposes, such as the illuminating
of narrow stretches of water, a wider beam is required, and
this is obtained by a diverging lens placed in front of the
arc. In passing through this lens the light is dispersed or
spread out to a greater or less extent according to the
nature of the lens. Searchlights are used in navigating
the Suez Canal by night, for lighting up the buoys along
the sides of the canal. The ordinary form of searchlight
does this quite well, but at the same time it illuminates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
equally an approaching vessel, so that the pilot on this
vessel is dazzled by the blinding glare. To avoid this
dangerous state of things a split reflector is used, which
produces two separate beams with a dark space between
them. In this way the sides of the canal are illuminated,
but the light is not thrown upon oncoming vessels, so that
the pilots can see clearly.</p>

<p>Glass reflectors are much more efficient than metallic
ones, but they have the disadvantage of being easily put
out of action by gunfire. This defect is remedied by protecting
the glass reflector by a screen of wire netting.
This is secured at the back of the reflector, and even if the
glass is shattered to a considerable extent, as by a rifle
bullet, the netting holds it together, and keeps it quite
serviceable. Reflectors protected in this way are not put
out of action by even two or three shots fired through
them. Searchlight arcs and reflectors are enclosed in metal
cylinders, which can be moved in any direction, vertically
or horizontally.</p>

<p>In the arc lamps already described, a large proportion
of the light comes from the incandescent carbon electrodes.
About the year 1901 an American electrician, Mr. P. C.
Hewitt, brought out an arc lamp in which the electrodes
took no part in producing the light, the whole of which
came from a glowing stream of mercury vapour. This
lamp, under the name of the Cooper-Hewitt mercury
vapour lamp, has certain advantages over other electric
illuminants, and it has come into extensive use.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23em;" id="fig_22">
  <img alt=" " height="1198" src="images/i_126.png" width="1775" id="id-2454167444385633305">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—Sketch of Mercury Vapour Lamp.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>It consists of a long glass tube, exhausted of air, and
containing a small quantity of mercury. Platinum wires to
take the current from the source of supply are sealed in at
each end. The tube is attached to a light tubular framework
of metal suspended from the ceiling, and this frame
is arranged so that it can be tilted slightly downwards by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
pulling a chain. As shown in <a href="#fig_22" class="pginternal">Fig. 22</a>, the normal position
of the lamp is not quite horizontal, but tilted slightly downwards
towards the end of the tube having the bulb containing
the mercury. The platinum wire at this end dips
into the mercury, so making a metallic contact with it.
The lamp is lighted by switching on the current and pulling
down the chain. The altered angle makes the mercury
flow along the tube towards the other platinum electrode,
and as soon as it touches this a conducting path for the
current is formed from end to end of the tube. The lamp
is now allowed to fall back to its original angle, so that the
mercury returns to its bulb. There is now no metallic connexion
between the electrodes, but the current continues
to pass through the tube as a vacuum discharge. Some
of the mercury is immediately vaporized and rendered
brilliantly incandescent, and so the light is produced. The
trouble of pulling down the chain is avoided in the
automatic mercury vapour lamp, which is tilted by an
electro-magnet. This magnet is automatically cut out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
circuit as soon as the tilting is completed and the arc
struck.</p>

<p>The average length of the tube in the ordinary form of
mercury vapour lamp is about 30 inches, and a light of
from 500 to 3000 candle-power is produced, according to
the current used. Another form, known as the “Silica”
lamp, is enclosed in a globe like that of an ordinary electric
arc lamp. The tube is only about 5 or 6 inches in
length, and it is made of quartz instead of glass, the
arrangements for automatically tilting the tube being
similar to those in the ordinary form of lamp.</p>

<p>The light of the mercury vapour lamp is different from
that of all other lamps. Its peculiarity is that it contains
practically no red rays, most of the light being yellow, with
a certain proportion of green and blue. The result is a
light of a peacock-blue colour. The absence of red rays
alters colour-values greatly, scarlet objects appearing
black; and on this account it is impossible to match colours
by this light. In many respects, however, the deficiency
in red rays is a great positive advantage. Every one who
has worked by mercury vapour light must have noticed
that it enables very fine details to be seen with remarkable
distinctness. This property is due to an interesting fact.
Daylight and ordinary artificial light is a compound or
mixture of rays of different colours. It is a well-known
optical fact that a simple lens is unable to bring all these
rays to the same focus; so that if we sharply focus an image
by red light, it is out of focus or blurred by blue light. This
defect of the lens is called “chromatic aberration.” The
eye too suffers from chromatic aberration, so that it cannot
focus sharply all the different rays at the same time. The
violet rays are brought to a focus considerably in front of
the red rays, and the green and the yellow rays come in
between the two. The eye therefore automatically and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
unconsciously effects a compromise, and focuses for the
greenish-yellow rays. The mercury vapour light consists
very largely of these rays, and consequently it enables the
image to be focused with greater sharpness; or, in other
words, it increases the acuteness of vision. Experiments
carried out by Dr. Louis Bell and Dr. C. H. Williams
demonstrated this increase in visual sharpness very conclusively.
Type, all of exactly the same size, was examined
by mercury vapour light, and by the light from an electric
incandescent lamp with tungsten filament. The feeling of
sharper definition produced by the mercury vapour light
was so strong that many observers were certain that the
type was larger, and they were convinced that it was
exactly the same only after careful personal examination.</p>

<p>Mercury vapour light apparently imposes less strain
upon the eyes than ordinary artificial light, and this
desirable feature is the result of the absence of the red rays,
which, besides having little effect in producing vision, are
tiring to the eyes on account of their heating action. The
light is very highly actinic, and for this reason it is largely
used for studio and other interior photographic work. In
cases where true daylight colour effects are necessary, a
special fluorescent reflector is used with the lamp. By
transforming the frequency of the light waves, this reflector
supplies the missing red and orange rays, the result being
a light giving normal colour effects.</p>

<p>Another interesting vapour lamp may be mentioned
briefly. This has a highly exhausted glass tube containing
neon, a rare gas discovered by Sir William Ramsay. The
light of this lamp contains no blue rays, and it is of a
striking red colour. Neon lamps are used chiefly for
advertising purposes, and they are most effective for
illuminated designs and announcements, the peculiar and
distinctive colour of the light attracting the eye at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>An electric current meets with some resistance in
passing through any substance, and if the substance is a
bad conductor the resistance is very great. As the current
forces its way through the resistance, heat is produced, and
a very thin wire, which offers a high resistance, may be
raised to a white heat by an electric current, and it then
glows with a brilliant light. This fact forms the basis of
the electric incandescent or glow lamp.</p>

<p>In the year 1878, Thomas A. Edison set himself the
task of producing a perfect electric incandescent lamp,
which should be capable of superseding gas for household
and other interior lighting. The first and the greatest
difficulty was that of finding a substance which could be
formed into a fine filament, and which could be kept
in a state of incandescence without melting or burning
away. Platinum was first chosen, on account of its very
high melting-point, and the fact that it was not acted
upon by the gases of the air. Edison’s earliest lamps
consisted of a piece of very thin platinum wire in the
shape of a spiral, and enclosed in a glass bulb from which
the air was exhausted. The ends of the spiral were
connected to outside wires sealed into the bulb. It was
found, however, that keeping platinum continuously at a
high temperature caused it to disintegrate slowly, so that
the lamps had only a short life. Fine threads or filaments
of carbon were then tried, and found to be much more
durable, besides being a great deal cheaper. The carbon
filament lamp quickly became a commercial success, and
up to quite recent years it was the only form of electric
incandescent lamp in general use.</p>

<p>In 1903 a German scientist, Dr. Auer von Welsbach,
of incandescent gas mantle fame, produced an electric lamp
in which the filament was made of the metal osmium, and
this was followed by a lamp using the metal tantalum for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the filament, the invention of Siemens and Halske. For a
while the tantalum lamp was very successful, but more
recently it has been superseded in popularity by lamps
having a filament of the metal tungsten. The success of
these lamps has caused the carbon lamp to decline in
favour. The metal filaments become incandescent much
more easily than the carbon filament, and for the same
candle-power the metal filament lamp consumes much less
current than the carbon lamp.</p>

<p>The construction of tungsten lamps is very interesting.
Tungsten is a very brittle metal, and at first the lamps
were fitted with a number of separate filaments. These
were made by mixing tungsten powder with a sort of paste,
and then squirting the mixture through very small
apertures, so that it formed hair-like threads. Early in
1911 lamps having a filament consisting of a single continuous
piece of drawn tungsten wire were produced. It
had been known for some time that although tungsten was
so brittle at ordinary temperatures, it became quite soft
and flexible when heated to incandescence in the lamp, and
that it lost this quality again as soon as it cooled down.
A process was discovered by which the metal could be
made permanently ductile, by mechanical treatment while
in the heated state. In this process pure tungsten powder
is pressed into rods and then made coherent by heating.
While still hot it is hammered, and finally drawn out into
fine wires through diamond dies. The wire is no thicker
than a fine hair, and it varies in size from about 0·012 mm.
to about 0·375 mm., according to the amount of current it
is intended to take. It is mounted by winding it continuously
zigzag shape round a glass carrier, which has at
the top and the bottom a number of metal supports
arranged in the form of a star, and insulated by a central
rod of glass. One star is made of strong, stiff material,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and the other consists of fine wires of some refractory
metal, molybdenum being used in the Osram lamps.
These supports act as springs, and keep the wire securely
in its original shape, no matter in what position the lamp
is used. The whole is placed in a glass bulb, which is
exhausted of air and sealed up.</p>

<p>For some purposes lamps with specially small bulbs are
required, and in these the tungsten wire is made in the
shape of fine spirals, instead of in straight pieces, so that
it takes up much less room. In the “Axial” lamp the
spiral is mounted in such a position that most of the light
is sent out in one particular direction.</p>

<p>The latest development in electric incandescent lamps is
the “half-watt” lamp. The watt is the standard of electrical
energy, and it is the rate of work represented by a current
of one ampere at a pressure of 1 volt. With continuous
currents the watts are found very simply by multiplying
together the volts and the amperes. For instance, a
dynamo giving a current of 20 amperes at a pressure
of 50 volts would be called a 1000-watt dynamo.
With alternating currents the calculation is more complicated,
but the final result is the same. The ordinary form
of tungsten lamp gives about one candle-power for every
watt, and is known as a one-watt lamp. As its name
suggests, the half-watt lamp requires only half this amount
of energy to give the same candle-power, so that it is very
much more economical in current. In this lamp the
tungsten filament is wound in a spiral, but instead of being
placed in the usual exhausted bulb, it is sealed into a bulb
containing nitrogen gas. The increased efficiency is
obtained by running the filament at a temperature from
400° to 600° C. higher than that at which the filament in
the ordinary lamp is used.</p>

<p>In spite of the great advances in artificial lighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
made during recent years, no one has yet succeeded in
producing light without heat. This heat is not wanted,
and it represents so much waste energy. It has often been
said that the glow-worm is the most expert of all illuminating
engineers, for it has the power of producing at will a
light which is absolutely without heat. Perhaps the nearest
approach to light without heat is the so-called “cold light”
invented by M. Dussaud, a French scientist. His device
consists of a revolving ring of exactly similar tungsten
lamps. Each of these lamps has current passed through it
in turn, and the duration of the current in each is so short,
being only a fraction of a second, that the lamp has not
sufficient time to develop any appreciable amount of heat.
The light from the ring of lamps is brought to a focus, and
passed through a lens to wherever it is required. Electric
incandescent lamps are made in a variety of sizes, each one
being intended for a certain definite voltage. If a lamp
designed for, say, 8 volts, is used on a circuit of
32 volts, its candle-power is greatly increased, while the
amount of current consumed is not increased in proportion.
In this way the lamp becomes a more efficient source
of light, but the “over-running,” as it is called, has a
destructive effect on the filament, so that the life of the
lamp is greatly shortened. In the Dussaud system however
the time during which each lamp has current passing
through it is so short, followed by a period of rest, that
the destructive effect of over-running is reduced to the
minimum; so that by using very high voltages an extremely
brilliant light is safely obtained with a comparatively
small consumption of current. It might be thought
that the constant interchange of lamps would result in an
unsteady effect, but the substitution of one lamp for another
is carried out so rapidly that the eye gets the impression of
perfect steadiness. The Dussaud system is of little use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
for ordinary lighting purposes, but for lighthouse illumination,
photographic studio work, and the projection of
lantern slides and cinematograph films, it appears to be of
considerable value.</p>

<p>Electric light has many advantages over all other
illuminants. It gives off very little heat, and does not use
up the oxygen in the air of a room as gas does; while by
means of flexible wires the lamps can be put practically
anywhere, so that the light may be had just where it is
wanted. Another great advantage is that the light may be
switched on without any trouble about matches, and there
is none of the danger from fire which always exists with
a flame.</p>

<p>The current for electric lamps is generally taken from
the public mains, but in isolated country houses a dynamo
has to be installed on the premises. This is usually driven
by a small engine running on petrol or paraffin. In order
to avoid having to run the engine and dynamo continually,
the current is not taken directly from the dynamo, but from
a battery of accumulators. During the day the dynamo is
used to charge the accumulators, and these supply the
current at night without requiring any attention.</p>

<p>Electric lighting from primary cells is out of the
question if a good light is wanted continuously for long
periods, for the process is far too costly and troublesome.
If a light of small candle-power is required for periods of
from a few minutes to about an hour, with fairly long
intervals of rest, primary cells may be made a success.
Large dry cells are useful for this purpose, but probably
the most satisfactory cell is the sack Leclanché. This is
similar in working to the ordinary Leclanché cell used for
bells, but the carbon mixture is placed in a canvas bag or
sack, instead of in a porous pot, and the zinc rod is replaced
by a sheet of zinc surrounding the sack. These cells give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
about 1½ volt each, so that four, connected in series,
are required to light a 6-volt lamp. The lamps must
take only a very small current, or the cells will fail
quickly. Small metal filament lamps taking from a third
to half an ampere are made specially for this purpose, and
these always should be used. A battery of sack Leclanché
cells with a miniature lamp of this kind forms a convenient
outfit for use as a night-light, or for lighting a dark cupboard,
passage or staircase. Lamps with ruby glass, or
with a ruby cap to slip over the bulb, may be obtained for
photographic purposes. If the outfit is wanted for use as
a reading-lamp it is better to have two separate batteries,
and to use them alternately for short periods. With this
arrangement each battery has a short spell of work followed
by a rest, and the light may be kept on for longer periods
without overworking the cells.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRIC HEATING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> light of the electric incandescent lamp is produced by
the heating to incandescence of a thin filament of metal or
carbon, and the heat itself is produced by the electric
current forcing its way through the great resistance opposed
to it by the filament. In such lamps the amount of heat
produced is too small to be of much practical use, but by
applying the same principle on a larger scale we get an
effective electric heater.</p>

<p>The most familiar and the most attractive of all electric
heaters is the luminous radiator. This consists of two or
more large incandescent lamps, having filaments of carbon.
The lamps are made in the form of long cylinders, the
glass being frosted, and they are set, generally in a vertical
position, in an ornamental case or frame of metal. This
case is open at the front, and has a metal reflector behind.
The carbon filaments are raised to an orange-red heat by
the passage of the current, and they then radiate heat rays
which warm the bulbs and any other objects in their path.
The air in contact with these heated bodies is warmed,
and gradually fills the room. This form of heater, with
its bright glowing lamps, gives a room a very cheerful
appearance.</p>

<p>In the non-luminous heaters, or “convectors” as they are
called, the heating elements consist of strips of metal or
wires having a very high resistance. These are placed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
a frame and made red-hot by the current. Cold air enters
at the bottom of the frame, becomes warm by passing over
the heating elements, and rises out at top and into the
room. More cold air enters the frame and is heated in
the same way, and in a very short time the whole of the
air of the room becomes warmed. The full power of the
heater is used in the preliminary warming of the room, but
afterwards the temperature may be kept up with a much
smaller consumption of current, and special regulating
switches are provided to give different degrees of heat.
Although these heaters are more powerful than the
luminous radiators, they are not cheerful looking; but in
some forms the appearance is improved by an incandescent
lamp with a ruby glass bulb, which shines through the
perforated front of the frame.</p>

<p>The Bastian, or red glow heater, has thin wires wound
in a spiral and enclosed in tubes made of quartz. These
tubes are transparent both to light and heat, and so the
pleasant glow of the red-hot wire is visible. A different
type of heater, the hot oil radiator, is very suitable for
large rooms. This has a wire of high resistance immersed
in oil, which becomes hot and maintains a steady
temperature.</p>

<p>Electric cooking appliances, like the heaters just described,
depend upon the heating of resistance wires or
strips of metal. The familiar electric kettle has a double
bottom, and in the cavity thus formed is placed the resistance
material, protected by strips of mica, a mineral
substance very largely used in electrical appliances of all
kinds on account of its splendid insulating qualities.
Electric irons are constructed in much the same way as
kettles, and sometimes they are used with stands which
cut off the current automatically when the iron is laid down
upon them, so that waste and overheating are prevented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
There are also a great many varieties of electric ovens,
grillers, hot-plates, water-heaters, glue-pots, and foot and
bed warmers. These of course differ greatly in construction,
but as they all work on the same principle there
is no need to describe them.</p>

<p>Electric hot-plates are used in an interesting way in
Glasgow, to enable the police on night duty to have a hot
supper. The plates are fitted to street telephone signal
boxes situated at points where a number of beats join. By
switching on current from the
public mains the policemen
are able to warm their food
and tea, and a supper interval
of twenty minutes is allowed.
Even policemen are sometimes
absent-minded, and to
avoid the waste of current and
overheating of the plate that
would result if a “bobby”
forgot to switch off, an arrangement
is provided which
automatically switches off the
current when the plate is not
in use.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>—Diagram to illustrate principle
of Electric Furnace.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>We must turn now to
electric heating on a much larger scale, in the electric
furnaces used for industrial purposes. The dazzling
brilliance of the light from the electric arc lamp is due
to the intense heat of the stream of vaporized carbon
particles between the carbon rods, the temperature of this
stream being roughly about 5400° F. This great heat
is made use of in various industries in the electric arc
furnace. <a href="#fig_23" class="pginternal">Fig. 23</a> is a diagram of a simple furnace of this
kind. A is a vertical carbon rod which can be raised or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
lowered, and B is a bed of carbon, forming the bottom of
the furnace, and acting as a second rod. A is lowered
until it touches B, the current, either continuous or alternating,
is switched on, and A is then raised. The arc is
thus struck between A and B, and the material contained
in the furnace is subjected to intense heat. When the
proper stage is reached the contents of the furnace are
drawn off at C, and fresh material is fed in from above,
so that if desired the process may be kept going continuously.
Besides the electric arc furnace there are also
resistance furnaces, in which the heat is produced by
the resistance of a conductor to a current passing
through it. This conductor may be the actual substance
to be heated, or some other resisting material placed close
to it.</p>

<p>It will be of interest to mention now one or two of
the uses of electric furnaces. The well-known substance
calcium carbide, so much used for producing acetylene gas
for lighting purposes, is a compound of calcium and
carbon; it is made by raising a mixture of lime and coke
to an intense heat in an electric furnace. The manufacture
of calcium carbide is carried on on a very large scale at
Niagara, with electric power obtained from the Falls, and
at Odda in Norway, where the power is supplied by the
river Tysse. Carborundum, a substance almost as hard
as the diamond, is largely used for grinding and polishing
purposes. It is manufactured by sending a strong current
through a furnace containing a core of coke surrounded by
a mixture of sand, sawdust, and carbon. The core becomes
incandescent, and the heating is continued until the
carbon combines with the sand, the process taking about
a day. Graphite, a kind of carbon, occurs naturally in the
form of plumbago, which is used for making black lead
pencils. It is obtained by mining, but many of the mines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
are already worked out, and others will be exhausted
before long. By means of the electric furnace, graphite
can now be made artificially, by heating anthracite
coal, and at Niagara a quantity running into thousands
of tons is produced every year. Electric furnaces are
now largely employed, particularly in France, in the
production of the various alloys of iron which are used
in making special kinds of steel; and they are used also
to a considerable extent in the manufacture of quartz
glass.</p>

<p>For many years past a great deal of time and money
has been spent in the attempt to make artificial diamonds.
Quite apart from its use in articles of jewellery, the
diamond has many very important industrial applications,
its value lying in its extreme hardness, which is not
equalled by any other substance. The very high price
of diamonds however is at present a serious obstacle to
their general use. If they could be made artificially on a
commercial scale they would become much cheaper, and
this would be of the greatest importance to many industries,
in which various more or less unsatisfactory substitutes are
now used on account of their much smaller cost. Recent
experiments seem to show that electricity will solve the
problem of diamond making. Small diamonds, one-tenth
of an inch long, have been made in Paris by means of the
electric arc furnace. The furnace contains calcium carbide,
surrounded by a mixture of carbon and lime, and the arc,
maintained by a very powerful current, is kept in operation
for several hours. A black substance, something like coke,
is formed round the negative carbon, and in this are found
tiny diamonds. The diamonds continue to increase slowly
in size during the time that the arc is at work, and it is estimated
that they grow at the rate of about one-hundredth
of an inch per hour. So far only small diamonds have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
been made, but there seems to be no reason why large ones
should not be produced, by continuing the process for three
or four days.</p>

<p>A chapter on electric heating would not be complete
without some mention of electric welding. Welding is the
process of uniting two pieces of metal by means of a combination
of heat and pressure, so that a strong and permanent
joint is produced. The chief difficulty in welding is
that of securing and keeping up the proper temperature,
and some metals are much more troublesome than others
in this respect. Platinum, iron, and steel are fairly easy to
weld, but most of the other metals, and alloys of different
metals, require very exact regulation of temperature. It
is almost impossible to obtain this exact regulation by
ordinary methods of heating, but the electric current makes
it a comparatively easy matter. The principle of ordinary
electric welding is very simple. The ends of the two
pieces of metal are placed together, and a powerful current
is passed through them. This current meets with a high
resistance at the point of contact of the two pieces, and so
heat is produced. When the proper welding temperature
is reached, and the metal is in a sort of pasty condition,
the two pieces are pressed strongly together, and the
current is switched off. The pieces are now firmly united
together. The process may be carried out by hand, the
welding smith switching the current on and off, and applying
pressure at the right moment by means of hydraulic
power. There are also automatic welders, which perform
the same operations without requiring any manual control.
Alternating current is used, of low voltage but very high
amperage.</p>

<p>Steel castings are sometimes found to have small
defects, such as cracks or blow-holes. These are not
discarded as useless, but are made quite sound by welding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
additional metal into the defective places by means of the
electric arc. The arc is formed between the casting and a
carbon rod, and the tremendous heat reduces the surface of
the metal to a molten condition. Small pieces or rods of
metal are then welded in where required.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRIC BELLS AND ALARMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> most familiar of all electrically worked appliances is
probably the electric bell, which in some form or other is
in use practically all over the world. Electric bells are
operated by means of a current of electricity sent through
the coils of an electro-magnet, and one of the very simplest
forms is that known as the single-stroke bell. In this bell
an armature or piece of soft iron is placed across, but at a
little distance from, the poles of an electro-magnet, and to
this piece of iron is fixed a lever terminating in a sort of
knob which lies close to a bell or gong. When a current
is sent round the electro-magnet the armature is attracted,
so that the lever moves forward and strikes a sharp blow
upon the gong. Before the gong can be sounded a second
time the current must be interrupted in order to make the
magnet release the armature, so that the lever may fall
back to its original position. Thus the bell gives only one
ring each time the circuit is closed. Bells of this kind may
be used for signalling in exactly the same way as the Morse
sounder, and sometimes they are made with two gongs of
different tones, which are arranged so as to be sounded
alternately.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—Diagram showing principle
of Bell-push.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>For most purposes however another form called the
trembler bell is much more convenient. <a href="#fig_24" class="pginternal">Fig. 24</a> is a rough
diagram of the usual arrangement of the essential parts of
a trembler bell. When the circuit is closed by pressing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
bell-push, a current flows from the battery to the electro-magnet
EE, by way of terminal T. The electro-magnet
then attracts the soft iron armature
A, thus causing the hammer H to
strike the gong. But immediately
the armature is pulled away from
the terminal T¹ the circuit is
broken and the magnet loses its
attraction for the armature, which
is moved back again into contact
with T¹ by the spring S. The
circuit is thus again closed, the
armature is again attracted, and
the hammer strikes the gong a
second time. This process goes
on over and over again at a great
speed as long as the bell-push is
kept pressed down, resulting in
an extremely rapid succession of
strokes upon the gong. It will
be noticed that the working of
this bell is very similar to that of the automatic contact-breaker
used for induction coils (<a href="#chapter_VIII" class="pginternal">Chapter VIII</a>.). For
household purposes this
form of bell has completely
driven out the once popular
wire-pulled bell. Bell-pushes
are made in a
number of shapes and
forms, and <a href="#fig_25" class="pginternal">Fig. 25</a> will
make clear the working
principle of the familiar form which greets us from almost
every doorway with the invitation, “Press.” In private
offices and elsewhere the rather aggressive sound of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
ordinary trembler bell is apt to become a nuisance, and
in such cases a modified form which gives a quiet buzzing
sound is often employed.</p>

<p>It is frequently necessary to have an electric bell which,
when once started, will continue ringing until it is stopped.
Such bells are used for fire and burglar alarms and for
many other similar purposes, and they are called continuous-ringing
bells as distinguished from the ordinary
trembler bells. In one common form of continuous-ringing
bell two separate batteries are used, one to start the bell
and the other to keep it ringing. When a momentary
current from the first battery is sent over the bell lines the
armature is attracted by the electro-magnet, and its movement
allows a lever to fall upon a metal contact piece.
This closes the circuit of the second battery, which keeps
the bell ringing until the lever is replaced by pulling a cord
or pressing a knob. Continuous-ringing bells are often
fitted to alarm clocks. The alarm is set in the usual way,
and at the appointed hour the bell begins to ring, and goes
on ringing until its owner, able to stand the noise no longer,
gets out of bed to stop it.</p>

<p>There is another form of electric bell which has been
devised to do away with the annoyance of bells suddenly
ceasing to work on account of the failure of the battery.
In this form the battery is entirely dispensed with, and
the current for ringing the bell is taken from a very small
dynamo fitted with a permanent steel horse-shoe magnet.
The armature is connected to a little handle, and current
is generated by twisting the handle rapidly to and fro
between the thumb and finger. A special form of bell is
required for this arrangement, which is not in general use.</p>

<p>In the days of wire-pulled bells it was necessary to have
quite a battery of bells of different tones for different rooms,
but a single electric bell can be rung from bell-pushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
placed in any part of a house or hotel. An indicator is
used to show which push has been pressed, and, this like
the bell itself, depends upon the attraction of an armature
by an electro-magnet. Before reaching the bell the wire
from each bell-push passes round a separate small electro-magnet,
which is thus magnetized by the current at the
same time that the bell is rung. In the simplest form of
indicator the attraction of the magnet causes a little flag to
swing backwards and forwards over its number. Another
form is the drop indicator, in which the movement of the
armature when attracted by the magnet allows a little flag
to drop, thus exposing the number of the room from which
the bell was rung. The dropped flag has to be replaced,
either by means of a knob fixed to a rod which pushes the
flag up again, or by pressing a push which sends the
current through another little electro-magnet so arranged
as to re-set the flag.</p>

<p>The electric current is used to operate an almost endless
variety of automatic alarms for special purposes. Houses
may be thoroughly protected from undesired nocturnal
visitors by means of a carefully arranged system of burglar
alarms. Doors and windows are fitted with spring contacts
so that the slightest opening of them closes a battery circuit
and causes an alarm to sound, and even if the burglar
succeeds in getting inside without moving a door or
window, say by cutting out a pane of glass, his troubles are
not by any means at an end. Other contacts are concealed
under the doormats, and under the carpets in passages and
stairways, so that the burglar is practically certain to tread
on one or other of them and so rouse the house. A window
may be further guarded by a blind contact. The blind is
left down, and is secured at the bottom to a hook, and the
slightest pressure upon it, such as would be given by a
burglar trying to get through the window, sets off the alarm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Safes also may be protected in similar ways, and a camera
and flashlight apparatus may be provided, so that when the
burglar closes the circuit by tampering with the safe he
takes his own photograph.</p>

<p>The modern professional burglar is a bit of a scientist
in his way, and he is wily enough to find and cut the wires
leading to the contacts, so that he can open a door or
window at his leisure without setting off the alarm. In
order to circumvent this little game, burglar alarms are
often arranged on the closed-circuit principle, so that the
alarm is sounded by the breaking of the circuit. A burglar
who deftly cut the wires of an alarm worked on this
principle would not be particularly pleased with the results
of his handiwork. The bells of burglar alarms may be
arranged to ring in a bedroom or in the street, and in the
United States, where burglar and in fact all electric
alarms are in more general use than in England, large
houses are sometimes connected to a police station, so that
the alarm is given there by bell or otherwise.</p>

<p>When an outbreak of fire is discovered it is of the
utmost importance that the nearest fire-station should be
notified instantly, for fire spreads with such rapidity that a
delay of even a few minutes in getting the fire-engines to
the spot may result in the total destruction of a building
which otherwise might have been saved. In almost all
large towns some system of public fire alarms is now in
use. The signal boxes are placed in conspicuous positions
in the streets, and sometimes also in very large buildings.
The alarm is generally given by the starting of a clockwork
mechanism which automatically makes and breaks a circuit
a certain number of times. When this occurs an alarm
bell rings at the fire-station, and the number of strokes on
the bell, which depends upon the number of times the
alarm mechanism makes and breaks the circuit, tells the
attendant from which box the alarm has been given. One
well-known form of call box has a glass front, and the
breaking of the glass automatically closes the circuit. In
other forms turning a handle or pulling a knob serves the
same purpose.</p>

<p>It is often required to maintain a room at one particular
temperature, and electricity may be employed to give an
alarm whenever the temperature rises above or falls below
a certain point. One arrangement for this purpose consists
of an ordinary thermometer having the top of the mercury
tube fitted with an air-tight stopper, through which a wire
is passed down into the tube as far as the mark indicating
the temperature at which the alarm is desired to sound.
Another wire is connected with the mercury in the bulb,
and the free ends of both wires are taken to a suitable
battery, a continuous-ringing bell being inserted in the
circuit at some convenient point. If a rise in temperature
takes place the mercury expands and moves up the tube,
and at the critical temperature it touches the wire, thus
completing the circuit and sounding the alarm. This
arrangement only announces a rise in temperature, but by
making the thermometer tube in the shape of a letter <span class="sans bold">U</span> an
alarm may be given also when the temperature falls below
a certain degree. A device known as a “thermostat” is also
used for the same purpose. This consists of two thin strips
of unlike metals, such as brass and steel, riveted together
and suspended between two contact pieces. The two
metals expand and contract at different rates, so that an
increase in temperature makes the compound strip bend in
one direction, and a decrease in temperature makes it bend
in the opposite direction. When the temperature rises or
falls beyond a certain limit the strip bends so far as to touch
one or other of the contact pieces, and the alarm is then
given. Either of the preceding arrangements can be used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
also as an automatic fire alarm, or if desired matters may be
arranged so that the closing of the circuit, instead of ringing
a bell, turns on or off a lamp, or adjusts a stove, and
in this way automatically keeps the room at a constant
temperature.</p>

<p>Electric alarms operated by ball floats are used to some
extent for announcing the rise or fall beyond a pre-arranged
limit of water or other liquids, and there is a very ingenious
electrical device by which the level of the water in a tank
or reservoir can be ascertained at any time by indicators
placed in convenient positions any distance away.</p>

<p>In factories and other large buildings a watchman is
frequently employed to make a certain number of rounds
every night. Being human, a night-watchman would much
rather sit and snooze over his fire than tramp round a dark
and silent factory on a cold winter night; and in order to
make sure that he pays regular visits to every point
electricity is called in to keep an eye on him. A good
eight-day clock is fitted with a second dial which is rotated
by the clockwork mechanism, and a sheet of paper, which
can be renewed when required, is placed over this dial.
On the paper are marked divisions representing hours and
minutes, and other divisions representing the various places
the watchman is required to visit. A press-button is fixed
at each point to be visited, and connected by wires with
the clock and with a battery. As the watchman reaches
each point on his rounds he presses the button, which is
usually locked up so that no one else can interfere with it,
and the current passes round an electro-magnet inside the
clock case. The magnet then attracts an armature which
operates a sort of fine-pointed hammer, and a perforation
is made in the paper, thus recording the exact time at
which the watchman visited that particular place.</p>

<p>The current for ordinary electric bells is generally supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
by Leclanché cells, which require little attention, and
keep in good working order for a very long time. As we
saw in <a href="#chapter_IV" class="pginternal">Chapter IV</a>., these bells soon polarize if used continuously,
but as in bell work they are required to give
current for short periods only, with fairly long intervals of
rest, no trouble is caused on this account. These cells
cannot be used for burglar or other alarms worked on the
closed-circuit principle, and in such cases some form of
Daniell cell is usually employed.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRIC CLOCKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Amongst</span> the many little worries of domestic life is the
keeping in order of the various clocks. It ought to be a
very simple matter to remember to wind up a clock, but
curiously enough almost everybody forgets to do so now
and then. We gaze meditatively at the solemn-looking
machine ticking away on the mantelpiece, wondering
whether we wound it up last week or not; and we wish
the wretched thing would go without winding, instead of
causing us all this mental effort.</p>

<p>There is usually a way of getting rid of little troubles
of this kind, and in this case the remedy is to be found in
an electrically-driven clock. The peculiar feature about
clocks driven by electricity is that they reverse the order
of things in key-wound clocks, the pendulum being made
to drive the clockwork instead of the clockwork driving
the pendulum. No driving spring is required, and the
motive power is supplied by a small electro-magnet.</p>

<p>The actual mechanism varies considerably in different
makes of clock. In one of the simplest arrangements there
is a pendulum with an armature of soft iron fixed to the
extremity of its bob. Below the pendulum is an electro-magnet,
and this is supplied with current from a small
battery of dry cells. A short piece of metal, called a “pallet,”
is attached to the rod of the pendulum by means of a
pivot; and as the pendulum swings it trails this pallet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
backwards and forwards along a horizontal spring. In this
spring are cut two small notches, one on each side of the
centre of the swing. As long as the pendulum is swinging
sufficiently vigorously, the pallet slides over these notches;
but when the swing has diminished to a certain point the
pallet catches in one or other of the notches. This has
the effect of pressing down the spring so that it touches a
contact piece just below, and the battery circuit is then
completed. The electro-magnet now comes into action
and attracts the armature, thus giving the pendulum a pull
which sets it swinging vigorously again. The spring is
then freed from the pressure of the pallet, and it rises to its
original position, so that the circuit is broken. This puts
out of action the electro-magnet, and the latter does no
further work until the pendulum requires another pull.
The movement of the pendulum drives the wheelwork,
which is similar to that of an ordinary clock, and the wheelwork
moves the hands in the usual way. A clock of this
kind will run without attention for several months, and
then the battery requires to be renewed. As time-keepers,
electrically-driven clocks are quite as good as, and often
very much better than key-wound clocks.</p>

<p>Everybody must have noticed that the numerous public
clocks in a large town do not often agree exactly with one
another, the differences sometimes being quite large; while
even in one building, such as a large hotel, the different
clocks vary more or less. This state of things is very
unsatisfactory, for it is difficult to know which of the clocks
is exactly right. Although large clocks are made with the
utmost care by skilled workmen, they cannot possibly be
made to maintain anything like the accuracy of a high-class
chronometer, such as is used by navigators; and the only
way to keep a number of such clocks in perfect agreement
is to control their movements from one central or master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
clock. This can be done quite satisfactorily by electricity.
The master-clock and the various sub-clocks are connected
electrically, so that a current can be sent from the master-clock
to all the others. Each sub-clock is fitted with an
electro-magnet placed behind the figure XII at the top of
the dial. At the instant when the master-clock reaches the
hour, the circuit is closed automatically, and the current
energizes these magnets. The minute hands of all the
sub-clocks are gripped by the action of the magnets, and
pulled exactly to the hour; the pulling being backward or
forward according to whether the clocks are fast or slow.
In this way all the clocks in the system are in exact agreement
at each hour. The same result may be attained by
adjusting all the sub-clocks so that they gain a little, say a
few seconds in the hour. In this case the circuit is closed
about half a minute before the hour. As each sub-clock
reaches the hour, its electro-magnet comes into action, and
holds the hands so that they cannot proceed. When the
master-clock arrives at the hour the circuit is broken, the
magnets release their captives, and all the clocks move
forward together.</p>

<p>It is possible to control sub-clocks so that their pendulums
actually beat exactly with the pendulum of the master-clock;
but only a small number of clocks can be controlled
in this way, and they must be of the best quality. The
method is similar to that used for hourly corrections, the
main difference being that the circuit is closed by the
pendulum of the master-clock at each end of its swing, so
that the pendulums of the sub-clocks are accelerated or
held back as may be required.</p>

<p>In the correcting systems already described the sub-clocks
are complete in themselves, so that they work quite
independently, except at the instant of correction. For
hotels, schools, and other large buildings requiring clocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
at a number of different points, a simpler arrangement is
adopted. Only one complete clock is used, this being the
master-clock, which may be wound either electrically or by
key. The sub-clocks are dummies, having only a dial with
its hands, and an electro-magnetic arrangement behind the
dial for moving the hands. The sub-clocks are electrically
connected with the master-clock, and the mechanism of this
clock is arranged to close the circuit automatically every
half-minute. Each time this occurs the magnet of each
sub-clock moves forward the hands half a minute, and in
this way the dummy clocks are made to travel on together
by half-minute steps, exactly in unison with the master-clock.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TELEGRAPH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> come now to one of the most important inventions of
the nineteenth century, the electric telegraph. From very
early times men have felt the necessity for some means of
rapidly communicating between two distant points. The
first really practical method of signalling was that of lighting
beacon fires on the tops of hills, to spread some important
tidings, such as the approach of an enemy. From this
simple beginning arose more complicated systems of signalling
by semaphore, flags, or flashing lights. All these
methods proved incapable of dealing with the rapidly
growing requirements of commerce, for they were far too
slow in action, and in foggy weather they were of no use
at all. We are so accustomed to walking into a telegraph
office, filling up a form, and paying our sixpence or more,
that it is very difficult for us to realize the immense importance
of the electric telegraph; and probably the best
way of doing this is to try to imagine the state of things
which would result if the world’s telegraphic instruments
were put out of action for a week or two.</p>

<p>The earliest attempts at the construction of an electric
telegraph date back to a time long before the discovery of
the electric current. As early as 1727 it was known that
an electric discharge could be transmitted to a considerable
distance through a conducting substance such as a moistened
thread or a wire, and this fact suggested the possibility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
a method of electric signalling. In 1753 a writer in <cite>Scott’s
Magazine</cite> brought forward an ingenious scheme based upon
the attraction between an electrified body and any light
substance. His telegraph was worked by an electric
machine, and it consisted of twenty-six separate parallel
wires, every wire having a metal ball suspended from it at
each end. Close to each ball was placed a small piece of
paper upon which was written a letter of the alphabet.
When any wire was charged, the paper letters at each end
of it were attracted towards the metal balls, and in this
way words and sentences were spelled out. Many other
systems more or less on the same lines were suggested
during the next fifty years, but although some of them had
considerable success in an experimental way, they were all
far too unreliable to have any commercial success.</p>

<p>With the invention of the voltaic cell, inventors’ ideas
took a new direction. In 1812 a telegraph based upon the
power of an electric current to decompose water was
devised by a German named Sömmering. He used a
number of separate wires, each connected to a gold pin
projecting from below into a glass vessel filled with
acidulated water. There were thirty-five wires in all, for
letters and numbers, and when a current was sent along
any wire bubbles of gas formed at the pin at the end of it,
and so the letters or numbers were indicated. This telegraph,
like its predecessors, never came into practical use.
Oersted’s discovery in 1829 of the production of magnetism
by electricity laid the foundation of the first really practical
electric telegraphs, but little progress was made until the
appearance of the Daniell cell, in 1836. The earlier forms
of voltaic cells polarized so rapidly that it was impossible
to obtain a constant current from them, but the non-polarizing
Daniell cell at once removed all difficulty in this
respect. In the year 1837 three separate practical telegraphs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
were invented: by Morse in the United States, by
Wheatstone and Cooke in England, and by Steinheil in
Munich.</p>

<figure class="figleft" style="max-width: 16em;" id="fig_26">
  <img alt=" " height="2021" src="images/i_158.png" width="1215" id="id-6532020063410463819">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—Dial of Five-Needle Telegraph.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The first telegraph of Wheatstone and Cooke consisted
of five magnetic needles
pivoted on a vertical
dial. The letters of the
alphabet were marked
on the dial, and the
needles were deflected
by currents made to
pass through wires by
the depression of keys,
so that two needles
would point towards
the required letter.
<a href="#fig_26" class="pginternal">Fig. 26</a> is a sketch of
the dial of this apparatus.
This telegraph was
tried successfully on the
London and North-Western
Railway, over
a wire a mile and a half
in length. Wheatstone
and Cooke afterwards
invented a single-needle
telegraph in which the
letters were indicated
by movements of the needle to the right or to the left,
according to the direction of a current sent through a coil
of wire. Wheatstone subsequently produced an apparatus
which printed the letters on paper.</p>

<p>In the United States, Morse had thought out a scheme
of telegraphy in 1832, but it was not until 1837 that he got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
his apparatus into working order. He was an artist by
profession, and for a long time he was unable to develop
his ideas for lack of money. After many efforts he succeeded
in obtaining a State grant of £6000 for the
construction of a telegraph line between Baltimore and
Washington, and the first message over this line was sent
in 1844, the line being thrown open to the public in the
following year. Amongst the features of this telegraph
were a receiving instrument which automatically recorded
the messages on a moving paper ribbon, by means of a
pencil actuated by an electro-magnet; and an apparatus
called a relay, which enabled the recording instrument to
be worked when the current was enfeebled by the resistance
of a very long wire. Morse also devised a telegraphic
code which is practically the same as that in use to-day.</p>

<p>The great discovery of the German Steinheil was that
a second wire for the return of the current was not necessary,
and that the earth could be used for this part of the circuit.</p>

<p>In reading the early history of great inventions one is
continually struck with the indifference or even hostility
shown by the general public. In England the electric
telegraph was practically ignored until the capture of a
murderer by means of it literally forced the public to see
its value. The murder was committed near Slough, and
the murderer succeeded in taking train for London.
Fortunately the Great Western Railway had a telegraph
line between Slough and London, and a description telegraphed
to Paddington enabled the police to arrest the
murderer on his arrival. In the United States too there
was just the same indifference. The rate for messages on
the line between Baltimore and Washington was one cent
for four words, and the total amount taken during the first
four days was one cent!</p>

<p>One of the simplest forms of telegraph is the single-needle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
instrument. This consists of a magnetic needle
fixed to a spindle at the back of an upright board through
which the spindle is passed. On the same spindle, but in
front of the board, is fixed a dial needle, which, of course,
moves along with the magnetic needle. A coil of wire is
passed round the magnetic needle, and connected to a
commutator for reversing
the direction of the
current. By turning a
handle to the left a
current is made to flow
through the coil, and
the magnetic needle
moves to one side; but
if the handle is turned
to the right the current
flows through the coil
in the opposite direction,
and the needle
moves to the other
side. Instead of a
handle, two keys may
be used, the movement
of the needle varying
according to which key
is pressed. A good
operator can transmit
at the rate of about twenty words a minute with this
instrument. The Morse code, which consists of combinations
of dots and dashes, is used, a movement of the
dial needle to the left meaning a dot, and one to the right
a dash. The code as used in the single-needle instrument
is shown in <a href="#fig_27" class="pginternal">Fig. 27</a>.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" style="max-width: 16em;" id="fig_27">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>—Code for Single-Needle Telegraph.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Needle instruments are largely used in railway signal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
cabins, but for general telegraphic work an instrument
called the Morse sounder is employed. This consists of
an electro-magnet which, when a current is passed through
it, attracts a small piece of iron fixed to one end of a
pivoted lever. The other end of this lever moves between
two stops. At the transmitting station the operator closes
a battery circuit by pressing a key, when the electro-magnet
of the sounder at the receiving station attracts the iron,
and the lever flies from one stop to the other with a sharp
click, returning again as soon as the circuit is broken. A
dot is signalled when the lever falls back immediately after
the click, and a dash when it makes a short stay before
returning. <a href="#fig_28" class="pginternal">Fig. 28</a> shows the code of signals for the
Morse telegraph.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;" id="fig_28">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—The Morse Code.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>In passing through a very long wire an electric current
becomes greatly reduced in strength owing to the resistance
of the wire. If two telegraph stations are a great distance
apart the energy of the current thus may be unequal to the
task of making the electro-magnet move the lever of the
sounder so as to produce a click, but this difficulty is overcome
by the use of an ingenious arrangement called a
“relay.” It consists of a very small electro-magnet which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
attracts a light bar, the movement of the bar being made
to close the circuit of another battery at the receiving
station. The feeble current works the relay, and the
current in the local circuit operates the sounder.</p>

<p>The word “telegraph,” which is derived from the Greek
<em>tele</em>, far off, and <em>grapho</em>, I write, strictly signifies writing at
a distance. The needle instrument and the sounder do not
write in any way, but by modifying the construction of the
sounder it can be made to record the messages it receives.
A small wheel is fitted to the free end of the lever of the
sounder, and an ink-well is placed so that the wheel dips
into it when the lever is in the normal position. When
the circuit is closed the lever moves just as in the ordinary
sounder, but instead of clicking against a stop it presses
the inked wheel against a paper ribbon which is kept
slowly moving forward by clockwork. In this way the
wheel continues to mark a line along the paper as long as
the circuit remains closed, and according to the time the
transmitting key is kept down a short mark or dot, or a
long mark or dash, is produced. The clockwork which
moves the paper ribbon is started automatically by the
current, and it continues working until the message is
finished.</p>

<p>A good Morse operator can maintain a speed of about
thirty words a minute, but this is far too slow for certain
kinds of telegraphic work, such as the transmission of press
news, and for such work the Wheatstone automatic transmitter
is used. First of all the messages are punched on
a paper ribbon. This is done by passing the ribbon from
right to left by clockwork through a punching machine
which is provided with three keys, one for dots, one for
dashes, and the other for spaces. If the left-hand key is
pressed, two holes opposite to one another are made,
representing a dot; and if the right-hand key is pressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
two diagonal holes are punched, representing a dash. In
<a href="#fig_29" class="pginternal">Fig. 29</a>, which shows a piece of ribbon punched in this
way, a third line of holes will be noticed between the outside
holes representing the dots and dashes. These holes
are for the purpose of guiding the paper ribbon steadily
along through the transmitting machine. The punched
ribbon is then drawn by clockwork through a Wheatstone
transmitter. In this machine two oscillating needles, connected
with one pole of a battery, are placed below the
moving ribbon. Each time a hole passes, these needles
make contact with a piece of metal connected with the
other pole of the battery, thus making and breaking the
circuit with much greater rapidity than is possible with
the Morse key. At the receiving station the messages are
recorded by a form of Morse inker, coming out in dots and
dashes as though sent by hand. Below the punched ribbon
in <a href="#fig_29" class="pginternal">Fig. 29</a> is shown the corresponding arrangement of dots
and dashes. The same punched ribbon may be used
repeatedly when the message has to be sent on a number
of different lines. The Wheatstone automatic machine is
capable of transmitting at the rate of from 250 to 400
words a minute. <a href="#fig_29" class="pginternal">Fig. 29</a> is a fragment of a <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite> Balkan War special, as transmitted to the
<cite>Yorkshire Post</cite> over the latter’s private wire from London
to Leeds. In the translation it will be seen that many
common words are abbreviated.</p>

<p>One weak point of telegraphy with Wheatstone instruments
is that the messages are received in Morse
code, and have to be translated. During recent years
telegraphs have been invented which actually produce
their messages in ordinary written or printed characters.
A very ingenious instrument is the Hughes printing
telegraph, which turns out messages in typewritten form.
Its mechanism is too complicated to be described here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
but in general it consists of a transmitter having a keyboard
something like that of a typewriter, by means of
which currents of electricity are made to press a sheet of
paper at the right instant against a revolving type-wheel
bearing the various characters. This telegraph has been
modified and brought to considerable perfection, and in
one form or another it is used in European countries and
in the United States.</p>

<p>In the Pollak-Virag system of telegraphy the action of
light upon sensitized photographic paper is utilized. An
operator punches special groupings of holes on a paper
ribbon about 1 inch wide, by means of a perforating
machine resembling a typewriter, and the ribbon is then
passed through a machine which transmits by brush contacts.
The receiver consists of a very small mirror
connected to two vibrating diaphragms, which control its
movements according to the currents received, one diaphragm
moving the mirror in a vertical direction, and the
other in a horizontal direction. The mirror reflects a ray
of light on to photographic bromide paper in the form of a
moving band about 3 inches in width, and the combined
action of the two diaphragms makes the mirror move so
that the ray of light traces out the messages in ordinary
alphabetical characters. As it moves forward after being
acted upon by the light, the paper is automatically developed
and fixed, and then passed through drying rollers. Although
the writing is rather imperfect in formation it is quite legible
enough for most messages, but trouble occasionally occurs
with messages containing figures, owing to confusion arising
from the similarity of the figures, 3, 5, and 8. The whole
process is carried out with such rapidity that 40,000 or
even more words can be transmitted easily in an hour.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of present-day telegraphs
is the Creed high-speed automatic printing telegraph.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
This has been devised to do away with hand working as
far as possible, and to substitute quicker and more accurate
automatic methods. In this system a perforated paper
tape is produced by a keyboard perforator at the sending
station. This tape is just ordinary Wheatstone tape, its
perforations representing in the Morse code the message to
be transmitted; and the main advantage of the Creed perforator
over the three-key punching machine already
described lies in the ease and speed with which it can be
worked. The keyboard contains a separate key for each
letter or signal of the Morse code, and the pressing of any
key brings into operation certain punches which make the
perforations corresponding to that particular letter. The
perforator can be worked by any one who understands how
to use an ordinary typewriter, and a speed of about 60
words a minute can be maintained by a fairly skilful
operator. If desired a number of tapes may be perforated
at the same time.</p>

<p>The tape prepared in this way is passed through a
Wheatstone transmitter, and long or short currents, according
to the arrangement of the perforations, are sent out
along the telegraph line. At the receiving station these
signals operate a receiving perforator. This machine
produces another perforated tape, which is an exact copy
of the tape at the sending station, and it turns out this
duplicate tape at the rate of from 150 to 200 words a
minute. There are two forms of this receiving perforator,
one worked entirely by electricity, and the other by a combination
of electricity and compressed air, both forms
serving the same purpose. The duplicate tape is then
passed through an automatic printer, which reproduces the
message in large Roman characters on a paper tape. The
printer works at a speed of from 80 to about 100 words a
minute, and the printed tape is pasted on a telegraphic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
form by a semi-automatic process, and the message is then
ready for delivery. <a href="#plate_XI" class="pginternal">Plate XI</a>. shows a specimen of the
tape from the receiving perforator, and the corresponding
translation as turned out by the printer. This message
formed part of a leading article in the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>. Some
idea of the wonderful capabilities of the Creed system may
be gained from the fact that by means of it practically the
whole contents of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> are telegraphed every
night from London to Manchester and Paris, for publication
next morning.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features about present-day
telegraphy is the ease with which two or more messages
can be sent simultaneously over one line. Duplex telegraphy,
or the simultaneous transmission of two separate
messages in opposite directions over one wire, is now
practised on almost every line of any importance. At first
sight duplex telegraphy seems to be an impossibility, for if
we have two stations, one at each end of a single wire, and
each station fitted with a transmitter and a receiver, it
appears as if each transmitter would affect not only the
receiver at the opposite end of the wire, but also the
receiver at its own end, thus causing hopeless confusion
when both transmitters were in use at the same time.
This actually would be the case with ordinary telegraphic
methods, but by the use of a special arrangement all confusion
in working is avoided.</p>

<p>We have seen that a magnetic needle is deflected by a
current passing through a coil of wire placed round it, and
that the direction in which the needle is deflected depends
upon the direction of the current in the coil. Now suppose
we place round the needle two coils of wire, wound so that
the current in one flows in a direction opposite to that of
the current in the other. Then, if we pass two equal
currents, one through each coil, it is evident that they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
neutralize one another, so that the needle will not be
deflected at all. In a duplex system one end of one of
these coils is connected to earth, say to a copper plate
buried in the ground, and one end of the other to the line
wire. The two remaining ends are arranged as branches
leading off from a single wire connected with the transmitting
key. The whole arrangement of coils and needle
is repeated at the other end of the line. If now the
transmitting key at station A is pressed, the circuit is closed
and a current flows along the single wire, and then divides
into two where the wire branches, half of it taking the path
through one coil and half the path through the other.
Equal currents thus flow through the oppositely wound
coils, and the needle at station A is not deflected. Leaving
the coils, one of these equal currents flows away to earth,
while the other passes out along the line wire. On its
arrival at station B the current is able to pass through only
one of the coils round the needle, and consequently the
needle is deflected and the signal given. In this way the
transmitting operator at station A is able to signal to station
B without affecting the receiver at his own end, and
similarly the operator at station B can transmit to A without
affecting the B receiver. Thus there can be no confusion
whether the transmitters are worked at different times or
simultaneously, for each transmitter affects only the
receiver at the opposite end of the line. The diagram in
<a href="#fig_30" class="pginternal">Fig. 30</a> will help to make clearer the general principle.
K and K¹ are the two transmitting keys which close the
circuit, and C and C¹ are the points at which the current
divides into two. Instead of coils and needles, electro-magnets
operating sounders may be used, such magnets
having two separate and oppositely wound coils, acting in
exactly the same way as the coils round the needles. The
above description is of course only a rough outline of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
method, and in practice matters are more complicated,
owing to the necessity for carefully adjusted resistances and
for condensers. There is also another and different method
of duplexing a line, but we have not space to describe it.
Duplex telegraphy requires two operators at each end of
the line, one to send and the other to receive.</p>

<p>Diplex telegraphy is the simultaneous transmission of
two separate messages in the same direction over one line.
Without going into details it may be said that for this
purpose two different transmitting keys are required, one of
which alters the direction, and the other the strength of the
current though the line wire. The receivers are arranged
so that one responds only to a strong current, and the other
only to a current in one particular direction. A line also
may be quadruplexed, so that it is possible to transmit
simultaneously two messages from each end, four operators
being required at each station, two to transmit and two
to receive. Systems of multiplex telegraphy have been
devised by which very large numbers of messages can be
sent at once over a single wire, and the Baudot multiplex
telegraph has proved very successful.</p>

<p>The wires for telegraphic purposes may be conveyed
either above or below the ground. Overground wires are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
carried on poles by means of insulators of porcelain or other
non-conducting material, protected by a sort of overhanging
screen. The wires are left bare, and they are generally
made of copper, but iron is used in some cases. In underground
lines the wires formerly were insulated by a covering
of gutta-percha, but now paper is generally used. Several
wires, each covered loosely with thoroughly dry paper, are
laid together in a bundle, the whole bundle or cable being
enclosed in a strong lead pipe. The paper coverings are
made to fit loosely so that the wires are surrounded by an
insulating layer of dry air. As many as 1200 separate
wires are sometimes enclosed in one pipe. In order to
keep telegraph lines in working order frequent tests are
necessary, and the most important British Postal Telegraph
lines are tested once a week between 7.30 and 7.45 a.m.
The earth is generally used for the return circuit in
telegraphy, and the ends of the return wires are connected
either to metal plates buried in the ground to a depth at
which the earth is permanently moist, or to iron gas or
water pipes. The current for telegraph working on a small
scale is usually supplied by primary cells, the Daniell cell
being a favourite for this purpose. In large offices the
current is generally taken from a battery of storage cells.</p>

<p>During the early days of telegraphy, overhead lines
were a source of considerable danger when thunderstorms
were taking place. Lightning flashes often completely
wrecked the instruments, giving severe shocks to those in
the vicinity, and in a few cases operators were killed at
their posts. Danger of this kind is now obviated by the
use of contrivances known as lightning arresters. There
are several forms of these, but only one need be mentioned.
The main features of this are two metal plates separated
slightly from one another, so that there is a small air gap
between them. One plate is connected to the line wire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
and the other to earth. Almost all lightning flashes consist
of an oscillatory discharge, that is one which passes a
number of times backwards and forwards between a cloud
and the earth. A very rapidly alternating discharge of
this kind finds difficulty in passing along the line wire,
being greatly impeded by the coils of wire in the various
pieces of apparatus; and although the resistance of this
air gap is very high, the lightning discharge will cross the
gap sooner than struggle along the line wire. In this way,
when a flash affects the line, the discharge jumps the gap
between the plates of the arrester and passes away harmlessly
to earth, without entering the telegraph office at all.
As was mentioned in <a href="#chapter_III" class="pginternal">Chapter III</a>., the prevalence of
magnetic storms sometimes renders telegraph lines quite
unworkable for a time, but although such disturbances
cause great delay and general inconvenience, they are not
likely to be at all dangerous. It is often possible to
maintain telegraphic communication during magnetic disturbances
by using two lines to form a complete metallic
loop, so that there is no earth return.</p>

<span class="subhead">SUBMARINE TELEGRAPHY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> story of submarine telegraphy is a wonderful record
of dogged perseverance in the face of tremendous obstacles
and disastrous failures. It would be of no interest to trace
the story to its very beginning, and so we will commence
with the laying of the first cable across the English
Channel from Dover to Calais, in 1850. A single copper
wire covered with a layer of gutta-percha half an inch thick
was used, and leaden weights were attached to it at intervals
of one hundred yards, the fixing of each weight necessitating
the stoppage of the cable-laying ship. The line was laid
successfully, but it failed after working for a single day, and
it afterwards turned out that a Boulogne fisherman had
hauled up the cable with his trawl. This line proved that
telegraphic communication between England and France
was possible, but the enterprise was assailed with every
imaginable kind of abuse and ridicule. It is said that some
people really believed that the cable was worked in the
style of the old-fashioned house bell, and that the signals
were given by pulling the wire! In the next year another
attempt was made by Mr. T. R. Crampton, a prominent
railway engineer, who himself contributed half of the
£15,000 required. The form of cable adopted by him
consisted of four copper wires, each covered with two layers
of gutta-percha, and the four enclosed in a covering formed
of ten galvanized iron wires wound spirally round them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
The line proved a permanent success, and this type of
cable, with certain modifications, is still in use. In 1852
three attempts were made to connect England and Ireland,
but the first two failed owing to the employment of cables
too light to withstand the strong tidal currents, and the
third was somehow mismanaged as regards the paying-out,
so that there was not enough cable to reach across. A
heavier cable was tried in the next year, and this was a
lasting success.</p>

<p>The success of these two cables led to the laying of
many other European cables over similar distances, but we
must now pass on to a very much bigger undertaking, the
laying of the Atlantic cable. In 1856 the Atlantic Telegraph
Company was formed, with the object of establishing
and working telegraphic communication between Ireland
and Newfoundland, the three projectors being Messrs.
J. W. Brett, C. T. Bright, and C. W. Field. The British
and the United States Governments granted a subsidy, in
return for which Government messages were to have
priority over all others, and were to be transmitted free.
The objections launched against the scheme were of course
many, some of them making very amusing reading. It is
however very strange to find so eminent a scientist as
Professor Airy, then Astronomer Royal, seriously stating
that it was a mathematical impossibility to submerge a
cable safely to such depths, and that even if this could be
done, messages could not be transmitted through such a
great length of cable.</p>

<p>It was estimated that a length of about 2500 nautical
miles would be enough to allow for all contingencies, and
the construction of the cable was commenced in February
1857, and completed in June of that year. It is difficult to
realize the gigantic nature of the task of making a cable of
such dimensions. The length of copper wire used in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
making the conductor was 20,500 miles, while the outer
sheathing took 367,500 miles of iron wire; the total length
of wire used being enough to go round the Earth thirteen
times. The cable was finally stowed away on board two
warships, one British and the other American.</p>

<p>The real troubles began with the laying of the cable.
After landing the shore end in Valentia Bay, the paying-out
commenced, but scarcely had five miles been laid when
the cable caught in the paying-out machinery and parted.
By tracing it from the shore the lost end was picked up
and spliced, and the paying-out began again. Everything
went well for two or three days, and then, after 380 miles
had been laid, the cable snapped again, owing to some
mismanagement of the brakes, and was lost at a depth of
2000 fathoms. The cable had to be abandoned, and the
ships returned to Plymouth.</p>

<p>In the next year, 1858, another attempt was made, with
new and improved machinery and 3000 miles of cable, and
this time it was decided that the two ships should start
paying-out from mid-ocean, proceeding in opposite directions
towards the two shores after splicing their cables. On the
voyage out the expedition encountered one of the most
fearful storms on record, which lasted over a week, and the
British man-of-war, encumbered with the dead weight of
the cable, came near to disaster. Part of the cable shifted,
and those on board feared that the whole of the huge mass
would break away and crash through the vessel’s side.
Sixteen days after leaving Plymouth the rendezvous was
reached, the cables were spliced and the ships started.
After the British ship had paid out 40 miles it was discovered
that the cable had parted at some distance from
the ship, and the vessels once more sought each other, and
spliced again ready for another effort. This time the cable
parted after each vessel had paid out a little more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
100 miles, and the ships were forced to abandon the
attempt.</p>

<p>The failure of this second expedition naturally caused
great discouragement, and the general feeling was that the
whole enterprise would have to be given up. The chairman
of the company recommended that in order to make the
best of a bad job the remainder of the cable should be sold,
and the proceeds divided amongst the shareholders, but
after great efforts on the part of a dauntless few who refused
to admit defeat, it was finally decided to make one
more effort. No time was lost, and on 17th July 1858
the vessels again sailed from Queenstown. As before, the
cables were spliced in mid-ocean, and this time, after many
anxious days, many false alarms, and one or two narrow
escapes from disaster through faulty pieces of cable discovered
almost too late, the cable was landed successfully
on both shores of the Atlantic early in August.</p>

<p>The Atlantic cable was now an accomplished fact, and
dismal forebodings were turned into expressions of extravagant
joy. The first messages passed between Queen
Victoria and the President of the United States, and
amongst the more important communications was one
which prevented the sailing from Canada of two British
regiments which had been ordered to India during the
Mutiny. In the meantime the Indian Mutiny had been
suppressed, and therefore these regiments were not required.
The dispatch of this message saved a sum of about
£50,000. The prospects of the cable company seemed
bright, but after a short time the signals began to grow
weaker and weaker, and finally, after about seven hundred
messages had been transmitted, the cable failed altogether.
This was a great blow to the general public, and we can
imagine the bitter disappointment of the engineers and
electricians who had laboured so hard and so long to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the cable into being. It was a favourable opportunity for
the croakers, and amongst a certain section of the public
doubts were expressed as to whether any messages had
been transmitted at all.</p>

<p>A great consultation of experts took place with the
object of determining the cause of the failure, and the
unanimous opinion was that the cable had been injured by
the use of currents of too great intensity. Some years
elapsed before another attempt could be made, but the
idea was never abandoned, and a great deal of study was
given to the problems involved. Mr. Field, the most
energetic of the original projectors, never relaxed his determination
that the cable should be made a success, and he
worked incessantly to achieve his ambition. It is said
that in pursuance of his object he made sixty-four crossings
of the Atlantic, and considering that he suffered greatly
from sea-sickness every time this shows remarkable pluck
and endurance.</p>

<p>In 1865, new capital having been raised, preparations
were made for another expedition. It was now decided
to use only one vessel for laying the cable, and the <i>Great
Eastern</i> was chosen for the task. This vessel had been
lying idle for close on ten years, owing to her failure as a
cargo boat, but her great size and capacity made her most
suitable for carrying the enormous weight of the whole
cable. In July 1865 the <i>Great Eastern</i> set sail, under
the escort of two British warships. When 84 miles had
been paid out, a fault occurred, and after drawing up about
10½ miles it was found that a piece of iron wire had pierced
the coating of the cable. The trouble was put right, and
the paying-out continued successfully until over 700 miles
had been laid, when another fault appeared. The cable
was again drawn in until the fault was reached, and
another piece of iron was found piercing clean through.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
It was evident that two such pieces of iron could not have
got there by accident, and there was no doubt that they
had been inserted intentionally by some malicious scoundrel,
most likely with the object of affecting the company’s
shares. A start was made once more, and all went well
until about two-thirds of the distance had been covered,
when the cable broke and had to be abandoned after
several nearly successful attempts to recover it.</p>

<p>In spite of the loss, which amounted to £600,000, the
energetic promoters contrived to raise fresh capital, and in
1866 the <i>Great Eastern</i> started again. This effort was
completely successful, and on 28th July 1866 the cable
was landed amidst great rejoicing. The following extracts
from the diary of the engineer Sir Daniell Gooch, give us
some idea of the landing.</p>

<p>“Is it wrong that I should have felt as though my
heart would burst when that end of our long line touched
the shore amid the booming of cannon, the wild, half-mad
cheers and shouts of the men?... I am given a never-dying
thought; that I aided in laying the Atlantic cable....
The old cable hands seemed as though they could
eat the end; one man actually put it into his mouth and
sucked it. They held it up and danced round it, cheering
at the top of their voices. It was a strange sight, nay, a
sight that filled our eyes with tears.... I did cheer, but
I could better have silently cried.”</p>

<p>This time the cable was destined to have a long and
useful life, and later in the same year the 1865 cable was
recovered, spliced to a new length, and safely brought to
land, so that there were now two links between the Old
World and the New. It was estimated that the total cost
of completing the great undertaking, including the cost of
the unsuccessful attempts, was nearly two and a half millions
sterling. Since 1866 cable-laying has proceeded very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
rapidly, and to-day telegraphic communication exists between
almost all parts of the civilized world. According
to recent statistics, the North Atlantic Ocean is now
crossed by no less than 17 cables, the number of cables
all over the world being 2937, with a total length of
291,137 nautical miles.</p>

<p>Before describing the actual working of a submarine
cable, a few words on cable-laying may be of interest.
Before the cable-ship starts, another vessel is sent over
the proposed course to make soundings. Galvanized steel
pianoforte wire is used for sounding, and it is wound in
lengths of 3 or 4 nautical miles on gun-metal drums.
The drums are worked by an engine, and the average
speed of working is somewhere about 100 fathoms a
minute in descending, and 70 fathoms a minute in picking
up. Some idea of the time occupied may be gained from
a sounding in the Atlantic Ocean which registered a depth
of 3233 fathoms, or nearly 3½ miles. The sinker took
thirty-three minutes fifty seconds in descending, and forty-five
minutes were taken in picking up. The heavy sinker
is not brought up with the line, but is detached from the
sounder by an ingenious contrivance and left at the bottom.
The sounder is fitted with an arrangement to bring up a
specimen of the bottom, and also a sample of water; and
the temperature at any depth is ascertained by self-registering
thermometers.</p>

<p>When the soundings are complete the cable-ship takes
up her task. The cable is coiled in tanks on board, and
is kept constantly under water to prevent injury to the
gutta-percha insulation by overheating. As each section
is placed in the tank, the ends of it are led to a test-box,
and labelled so that they can be easily recognized. Insulated
wires run from the test-box to instruments in the
testing-room, so that the electrical condition of the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
cable is constantly under observation. During the whole
time the cable is being laid its insulation is tested continuously,
and at intervals of five minutes signals are sent from
the shore end to the ship, so that a fault is instantly detected.
The cable in its tank is eased out by a number of
men, and mechanics are posted at the cable drums and
brakes, while constant streams of water cool the cable and
the bearings and surfaces of the brakes. The tension, as
shown by the dynamometer, is at all times under careful
observation. When it becomes necessary to wind back the
cable on account of some fault, cuts are made at intervals
of a quarter or half a mile, tests being made at each cutting
until the fault is localized in-board. As soon as the cable
out-board is found “O.K.,” the ends are spliced up and the
paying-out begins again. If the cable breaks from any
cause, a mark-buoy is lowered instantly on the spot, and
the cable is grappled for. This may take a day or two in
good weather, but a delay of weeks may be caused by bad
weather, which makes grappling impossible.</p>

<p>The practical working of a submarine cable differs in
many respects from that of a land telegraph line. The
currents used in submarine telegraphy are extremely small,
contrary to the popular impression. An insulated cable
acts like a Leyden jar, in the sense that it accumulates
electricity and does not quickly part with it, as does a bare
overhead wire. In the case of a very long cable, such as
one across the Atlantic, a current continues to flow from it
for some time after the battery is disconnected. A second
signal cannot be sent until the electricity is dissipated and
the cable clear, and if a powerful current were employed
the time occupied in this clearing would be considerable, so
that the speed of signalling would be slow. Another
objection to a powerful current is that if any flaw
exists in the insulation of the cable, such a current is apt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
to increase the flaw, and finally cause the breakdown of
the line.</p>

<p>The feebleness of the currents in submarine telegraphy
makes it impossible to use the ordinary land telegraph
receiver, and a more sensitive instrument known as the
“mirror receiver” is used. This consists of a coil of very
fine wire, in the centre of which a tiny magnetic needle is
suspended by a fibre of unspun silk. A magnet placed close
by keeps the needle in one position when no current is
flowing. As the deflections of the needle are extremely
small, it is necessary to magnify them in some way, and
this is done by fixing to the needle a very small mirror,
upon which falls a ray of light from a lamp. The mirror
reflects this ray on to a sheet of white paper marked with
a scale, and as the mirror moves along with the needle the
point of light travels over the paper, a very small movement
of the needle causing the light to travel some inches.
The receiving operator sits in a darkened room and
watches the light, which moves to the right or to the left
according to the direction of the current. The signals
employed are the same as those for the single-needle
instrument, a movement to the left indicating a dot, and
one to the right a dash. In many instruments the total
weight of magnet and mirror is only two or three grains,
and the sensitiveness is such that the current from a voltaic
cell consisting of a lady’s silver thimble with a few drops of
acidulated water and a diminutive rod of zinc, is sufficient
to transmit a message across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The mirror receiver cannot write down its messages,
and for recording purposes an instrument invented by Lord
Kelvin, and called the “siphon recorder,” is used. In this
instrument a coil of wire is suspended between the poles of
an electro-magnet, and to it is connected by means of a silk
fibre a delicate glass tube or siphon. One end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
siphon dips into an ink-well, and capillary attraction causes
the ink to fill the siphon. The other end of the siphon
almost touches a moving paper ribbon placed beneath it.
The ink and the paper are oppositely electrified, and the
attraction between the opposite charges causes the ink to
spurt out of the siphon in very minute drops, which fall on
to the paper. As long as no current is passing the siphon
remains stationary, but when a current flows from the cable
through the coil, the latter moves to one side or the other,
according to the direction of the current, and makes the
siphon move also. Consequently, instead of a straight line
along the middle of the paper ribbon, a wavy line with
little peaks on each side of the centre is produced by the
minute drops of ink. This recorder sometimes refuses to
work properly in damp weather, owing to the loss of the
opposite charges on ink and paper, but a later inventor,
named Cuttriss, has removed this trouble by using a siphon
kept constantly in vibration by electro-magnetism. The
ordinary single-needle code is used for the siphon recorder.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TELEPHONE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> our younger days most of us have amused ourselves
with a toy telephone consisting of a long piece of string
having each end passed through the bottom of a little cardboard
box, and secured by a knot. If the string is stretched
tightly this arrangement enables whispered words to be
heard at a distance of 20 or 30 yards. Simple as is
this little toy, yet it is probable that many people would
be rather nonplussed if asked suddenly to explain how the
sounds travel along the string from one box to the other.
If the toy had some complicated mechanism most likely
every one would want to know how it worked, but the whole
thing is so extremely simple that generally it is dismissed
without a thought.</p>

<p>If we strike a tuning-fork and then hold it close to the
ear, we hear that it produces a sound, and at the same time,
from a slight sensation in the hand, we become aware that
the fork is in vibration. As the fork vibrates it disturbs
the tiny particles of air round it and sets them vibrating,
and these vibrations are communicated from one particle to
another until they reach the drum of the ear, when that also
begins to vibrate and we hear a sound. This is only
another way of saying that the disturbances of the air
caused by the vibrations of the tuning-fork are propagated
in a series of waves, which we call “sound waves.” Sound is
transmitted better through liquids than through the air, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
better still through solids, and this is why words spoken so
softly as to be inaudible through the air at a distance of,
say, 100 feet, can be heard fairly distinctly at that distance
by means of the string telephone. The sound reaches us
along the string in exactly the same way as through the air,
that is, by means of minute impulses passed on from particle
to particle.</p>

<p>A more satisfactory arrangement than the string telephone
consists of two thin plates of metal connected by a
wire which is stretched very tightly. Words spoken close
to one plate are heard by a listener at the other plate up to
a considerable distance. Let us try to see exactly what
takes place when this apparatus is used. In the act of
speaking, vibrations are set up in the air, and these in turn
set up vibrations in the metal plate. The vibrations are
then communicated to the wire and to the metal plate at
the other end, and finally the vibrations of this plate produce
vibrations in the air between the plate and the listener,
and the sound reaches the ear.</p>

<p>This simple experiment shows the remarkable fact that
a plate of metal is able to reproduce faithfully all the vibrations
communicated to it by the human voice, and from this
fact it follows that if we can communicate the vibrations set
up in one plate by the voice, to another plate at a distance
of 100 miles, we shall be able to speak to a listener
at the further plate just as if he were close to us. A
stretched string or wire transmits the vibrations fairly well
up to a certain distance, but beyond this distance the vibrations
become weaker and weaker until no sound at all
reaches the air. By the aid of electricity, however, we can
transmit the vibrations to a tremendous distance, the range
being limited only by the imperfections of our apparatus.</p>

<p>The first attempt at the construction of an electric
telephone, that is an instrument by means of which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
vibrations set up by the voice or by a musical instrument
are transmitted by electricity, was made in 1860 by Johann
Philipp Reis, a teacher in a school at Friedrichsdorf, in
Germany. His transmitting apparatus consisted of a box
having a hole covered by a tightly stretched membrane, to
which was attached a little strip of platinum. When the
membrane was made to vibrate by sounds produced close
to the box, the strip of platinum moved to and fro against
a metal tip, which closed the circuit of a battery. The
receiver was a long needle of soft iron round which was
wound a coil of wire, and the ends of the needle rested on
two little bridges of a sounding box. The vibrations of
the membrane opened and closed the circuit at a great
speed, and the rapid magnetization of the needle produced
a tone of the same pitch as the one which set the membrane
vibrating. This apparatus transmitted musical sounds and
melodies with great accuracy, but there is considerable
difference of opinion as to whether it was able to transmit
speech. Professor Sylvanus Thompson distinctly states
that Reis’s telephone could and did transmit speech, but
other experts dispute the fact. We probably shall be quite
safe in concluding that this telephone did transmit speech,
but very imperfectly. In any case it is certain that the
receiver of this apparatus is not based on the same principle
as the modern telephone receiver.</p>

<p>Some years later Graham Bell, Professor of Vocal
Physiology in the University of Boston, turned his attention
to the electric transmission of speech, probably being led to
do so from his experiments in teaching the deaf and dumb.
His apparatuses shown at an exhibition in Philadelphia in
1876, consisted of a tube having one end open for speaking
into, and the other closed by a tightly stretched membrane
to which was attached a very light steel bar magnet. The
vibrations set up in the membrane by the voice made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
little magnet move to and fro in front of the poles of an
electro-magnet, inserted in a battery circuit, thus inducing
currents of electricity in the coils of the latter magnet.
The currents produced in this way varied in direction and
strength according to the vibratory movements of the
membrane, and being transmitted along a wire they
produced similar variations in current in another electro-magnet
in the receiver. The currents produced in this
manner in the receiver set up vibrations in a metal
diaphragm in front of the magnet poles, and so the words
spoken into the transmitter were reproduced.</p>

<p>Since the year 1876 the telephone has developed with
remarkable rapidity, and an attempt to trace its growth
would involve a series of detailed descriptions of closely
similar inventions which would be quite uninteresting to
most readers. Now, therefore, that we have introduced
the instruments, and seen something of its principle and
its early forms, it will be most satisfactory to omit the
intermediate stages and to go on to the telephone as used
in recent years. The first telephone to come into general
use was the invention of Graham Bell, and was an improved
form of his early instrument just described. A case or
tube of ebonite, which forms the handle of the instrument,
contains a steel bar magnet having a small coil of insulated
wire at the end nearest the mouthpiece of the tube, the
ends of the coil passing along the tube to be connected to
the line wires. Close to the coil end of the magnet, and
between it and the mouthpiece, is fixed a diaphragm of
thin sheet-iron. A complete outfit consists of two of these
instruments connected by wires, and it will be noticed that
no battery is employed.</p>

<p>The air vibrations set up by the voice make the
diaphragm vibrate also, so that it moves backwards and
forwards. These movements are infinitesimally small, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
they are sufficient to affect the lines of force of the magnet
to such an extent that rapidly alternating currents of varying
degrees of strength are set up in the coil and sent along
the line wire. On arriving at the receiver these currents
pass through the coil and produce rapid variations in the
strength of the magnet, so that instead of exerting a
uniform attraction upon the iron diaphragm, the magnet
pulls it with constantly varying force, and thus sets it
vibrating. The air in front of the diaphragm now begins
to vibrate, and the listener hears a reproduction of the
words spoken into the transmitter. The way in which the
fluctuations of the current make the second diaphragm
vibrate exactly in accordance with the first is very remarkable,
and it is important to notice that the listener does not
hear the actual voice of the speaker, but a perfect reproduction
of it; in fact, the second diaphragm speaks.</p>

<p>The reader probably will be surprised to be told that
the transmitter and the receiver of a magneto-electric
telephone are respectively a dynamo and electric motor of
minute proportions. We provide a dynamo with mechanical
motion and it gives us electric current, and by sending
this current through an electric motor we get mechanical
motion back again. In the transmitter of the telephone
just described, the mechanical motion is in the form of
vibrations of the metal diaphragm, which set up currents of
electricity in the coil of wire round the magnet, so that the
transmitter is really a tiny dynamo driven by the voice.
The receiver is provided with electric current from the
transmitter, and it converts this into mechanical motion in
the diaphragm, so that the receiver is a little electric motor.</p>

<p>Transmitters of the type just described work well over
short distances, but the currents they produce are too feeble
for transmission over a very long wire, and on this account
they have been superseded by transmitters on the microphone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
principle. A microphone is an instrument for
making extremely small sounds plainly audible. If a
current is passed through a box containing loose bits of
broken carbon, it meets with great resistance, but if the
bits of carbon are compressed their conducting power is
considerably increased. Even such slight differences in
pressure as are produced by vibrating the box will affect
the amount of current passing through the carbon. If this
current is led by wires to an ordinary telephone receiver
the arrangement becomes a simple form of microphone.
The vibrations of the box vary
the resistance of the carbon,
and the corresponding variations
in the current set up
vibrations in the receiver, but
in a magnified form. The
smallest sound vibrations alter
the resistance of the carbon,
and as these vibrations are
magnified in the receiver, the
reproduced sound is magnified
also. The footsteps of a fly
may be heard quite distinctly by means of a good microphone,
and the ticks of a watch sound like the strokes of a
hammer.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>—Diagram of Microphone Transmitter.
</figcaption></figure>

<p>By means of this power of magnifying vibrations a
microphone transmitter can be used on a line of tremendous
length, where an ordinary Bell transmitter would be utterly
useless. The general features of this transmitter, <a href="#fig_31" class="pginternal">Fig. 31</a>,
are a diaphragm and a block of carbon separated slightly
from one another, the intervening space being filled with
granules of carbon. These are enclosed in a case of
ebonite having a mouthpiece in front and two terminals
behind, one terminal being connected with the carbon block<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
and the other with the diaphragm. From these terminals
wires are led to a battery and to the receiver, which is of
the Bell type. The current has to pass through the carbon
granules, and the movements of the diaphragm when set in
vibration by the voice vary the pressure upon the granules,
and in this way set up variations in the current. Carbon
dust also may be used instead of granular carbon, and then the
instrument is called a “dust transmitter.”</p>

<p>It is usual to have a transmitter and
a receiver on one handle for the greater
convenience of the user. The arrangement
is shown in <a href="#fig_32" class="pginternal">Fig. 32</a>, and it will be
seen that when the user places the receiver
to his ear the transmitting mouthpiece is
in position for speaking. The microphone
with its carbon dust is placed at A, just
below the mouthpiece, and the earpiece
or receiver B contains a little magnet and
coil with a diaphragm in front, so that it
is really a Bell instrument. A little lever
will be noticed at C. This is a switch
which brings the transmitter into circuit
on being pressed with the finger.</p>

<p>It is now time to see something of the
arrangement and working of telephone
systems. As soon as the telephone became a commercially
practicable instrument the necessity for some means of
inter-communication became evident, and the telephone
exchange was brought into being. The first exchange
was started in 1877, in Boston, but this was a very
small affair and it was run on very crude lines. When
one subscriber wished to communicate with another he
had to call up an operator, who received the message
and repeated it to the person for whom it was intended;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
there was no direct communication between the various
subscribers’ instruments. As the number of users increased
it became necessary to devise some system
whereby each subscriber could call the attention of an
operator at the central station, and be put into direct
communication with any other subscriber without delay;
and the exchange system of to-day, which fulfils these
requirements almost to perfection, is the result of gradual
improvements in telephone methods extending over some
thirty-five years.</p>

<p>When a subscriber wishes to telephone, he first must
call up the operator at the exchange. Until comparatively
recently this was done by turning a handle placed at the
side of the instrument. This handle operated a little
dynamo, and the current produced caused a shutter at the
exchange to drop and reveal a number, just as in the
electric bell indicator, so that the operator knew which
instrument was calling. As soon as the operator answered
the call, the shutter replaced itself automatically. The
signal to disconnect was given in the same way, but the
indicator was of a different colour in order to prevent confusion
with a call signal. These handle-operated telephones
are still in common use, but they are being replaced by
instruments which do away with handle-turning on the
part of the subscriber, and with dropping shutters at the
exchange. In this latest system all that the subscriber has
to do is to lift his telephone from its rest, when a little
electric lamp lights up at the exchange; and when he has
finished his conversation he merely replaces the telephone,
and again a little lamp glows.</p>

<p>We must now see what happens at the exchange when
a call is made. Each operator has control of a number of
pairs of flexible cords terminating in plugs, the two cords
of each pair being electrically connected. The plugs rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
on a shelf in front of the operator, and the cords pass
through the shelf and hang down below it. If a plug is
lifted, the cord comes up through the shelf, and it is drawn
back again by a weight when the plug is not in use. Two
lamps are provided for each pair of cords, one being fixed
close to each cord. The two wires leading from each
subscriber’s instrument are connected to a little tube-shaped
switch called a “jack,” and each jack has a lamp of its own.
When a subscriber lifts his telephone from its rest a lamp
glows, and the operator inserts one plug of a pair into the
jack thus indicated, and the lamp goes out automatically.
She then switches on her telephone to the caller and asks
for the number of the subscriber to whom he wishes to
speak; and as soon as she gets this she inserts the other
plug of the pair into the jack belonging to this number.
By a simple movement she then rings up the required
person by switching on the current to his telephone bell.</p>

<p>Here comes in the use of the two lamps connected with
the cords. As long as the subscribers’ telephones are on
their rests the lamps are lighted, but as soon as they are
lifted off the lamps go out. The caller’s telephone is of
course off its rest, and so the lamp connected with the first
cord is not lit; but until the subscriber rung up lifts his
instrument to answer the call, the lamp of the second cord
remains lit, having first lighted up when the plug was
inserted in the jack of his number. When the second
lamp goes out the operator knows that the call has been
responded to, and that the two subscribers are in communication
with each other. Having finished their conversation,
both subscribers replace their instruments on the
rests, whereupon both lamps light up, informing the operator
that she may disconnect by pulling out the plugs.</p>

<p>It is manifestly impossible for one operator to attend
to the calls of all the subscribers in the exchange, and so a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
number of operators are employed, each one having to
attend to the calls of a certain number of subscribers. At
the same time it is clear that each operator may be called
upon to connect one of her subscribers to any other subscriber
in the whole exchange. In order to make this
possible the switchboard is divided into sections, each
having as many jacks as there are lines in the exchange, so
that in this respect all the sections are multiples of each
other, and the whole arrangement is called a “multiple
switchboard,” the repeated jacks being called “multiple
jacks.” Then there are other jacks which it is not necessary
to duplicate. We have seen that when a subscriber calls the
exchange a lamp glows, and the operator inserts a plug into
the jack beside the lamp, in order to answer the call and
ascertain what number is required. These are called
“answering jacks,” and the lamp is the line signal. It is
usual to have three operators to each section of the switchboard,
and each operator has charge of so many answering
jacks, representing so many subscribers. At the same
time she has access to the whole section, so that she can
connect any of her subscribers to any other line in the
exchange.</p>

<p>When a number is called for, the operator must be able
to tell at once whether the line is free or not. The jack
in her section may be unoccupied, but she must know also
whether all the multiple jacks belonging to that number
are free, for an operator at another section may have
connected the line to one of her subscribers. To enable
an operator to ascertain this quickly an electrical test is
provided. When two lines are connected, the whole of the
multiple jacks belonging to each are charged with electricity,
and if an operator at any section touches one of these jacks
with a plug, a current through her receiver makes a click,
and on hearing the click she knows that the line is engaged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
The testing takes an extremely short time, and this is why a
caller receives the reply, “Number engaged,” so promptly
that he feels inclined to doubt whether the operator has
made any attempt at all to connect him up to the number.</p>

<p>In order that an operator may have both hands free to
manipulate the plugs, her telephone receiver is fixed over
one ear by a fastening passing over her head, and the
transmitter is hung from her shoulders so as to be close to
her mouth.</p>

<p>In telegraphy it is the rule to employ the earth for the
return part of the circuit, but this is not customary in
telephony. The telephone is a much more sensitive
instrument than the telegraph, and a telephone having an
earth return is subject to all kinds of strange and weird
noises which greatly interfere with conversation. These
noises may be caused by natural electrical disturbances, or
by the proximity of telegraph and other wires conveying
electric currents. On this account telephone lines are
made with a complete metallic circuit. As in telegraphy,
protection from lightning flashes is afforded by lightning
arresters. The current for the working of a telephone
exchange is supplied from a central battery of accumulators,
and also from dynamos.</p>

<p>Although the manual exchange telephone system of
to-day works with remarkable efficiency, it has certain
weak points. For instance, if an operator cares to do so,
she can listen to conversations between subscribers, so
that privacy cannot be assured. As a matter of fact, the
operators have little time for this kind of thing, at any rate
during the busy hours of the day, and as a rule they are
not sufficiently interested in other people’s affairs to make
any attempt to listen to their remarks. The male operators
who work through the slack hours of the night are
occasionally guilty of listening. Some time ago the writer
had to ring up a friend in the very early morning, and
during the conversation this gentleman asked what time it
was. Before the writer had time to get a word out, a deep
bass voice from the exchange replied, “Half-past two.”
Little incidents of this sort remind one that it is not wise
to speak too freely by telephone. Then again operators are
liable to make wrong connexions through faulty hearing
of the number called for, and these are equally annoying to
the caller and to the person rung up in mistake. Many
other defects might be mentioned, but these are sufficient
to show that the manual system is not perfect.</p>

<p>For a long time inventors have been striving to do
away with all such defects by abolishing the exchange
operators, and substituting mechanism to work the
exchanges automatically, and during the last few years the
system of the Automatic Electric Company, of Chicago,
has been brought to great perfection. This system is in
extensive use in the United States, and is employed in
two or three exchanges in this country. Unfortunately
the mechanism of this system is extremely complicated, so
that it is impossible to describe it fully in a book of this
kind; but some idea of the method of working may be
given without entering into technical details.</p>

<p>Each subscriber’s telephone instrument is fitted with a
dial which turns round on a pivot at its centre. This dial
has a series of holes round its circumference, numbered
consecutively from 1 to 9, and 0. Suppose now a
subscriber wishes to speak to a friend whose telephone
number is 2583. He removes the receiver from its hook,
places his finger in the hole marked 2, and turns the dial
round in a clockwise direction until his finger comes in
contact with a stop. He then removes his finger, and the
dial automatically returns to its original position. He then
places his finger in the hole marked 5, and again turns the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
dial as far as the stop, and when the dial has returned to
the normal position he repeats the process with his finger
placed successively in the holes marked 8 and 3. He now
places the receiver to his ear, and by the time he has done
this the automatic mechanism at the exchange has made
the necessary connexions, and has rung the bell of
subscriber number 2583. On completing the conversation
each subscriber returns his receiver to its hook, and the
exchange mechanism returns to its normal position.</p>

<p>The turning of the dial by the finger coils up a spring,
and this spring, acting along with a speed governor, makes
the dial return to its first position at a certain definite
speed as soon as the finger is removed. During this
retrograde movement a switch automatically sends out into
the line a certain number of impulses, the number being
determined by the hole in which the finger is placed. In
the case supposed, groups of two, five, eight, and three
impulses respectively would be sent out, each group
separated from the next by an interval during which the
subscriber is turning the dial.</p>

<p>Now let us see what takes place at the exchange.
The subscriber’s instrument is connected to a mechanical
arrangement known as a “line switch.” This switch
is brought into play by the act of removing the receiver
from its hook, and it then automatically connects the
subscriber’s line to what is called a “first selector” switch.
The group of two impulses sent out by the first turning of
the dial raises this first selector two steps, and it then
sweeps along a row of contacts connected to “trunks”
going to the 2000 section. Passing by occupied trunks, it
finds an idle one, and so connects the line to an idle
“second selector.” This selector is operated by the second
group of impulses, five in number, and after being raised
five steps it acts like the first selector, and finds an idle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
trunk leading to the 2500 section. This places the caller’s
line in connexion with still another switch called a
“connector,” and this switch, operated by the remaining
groups of eight and three impulses, finds the required tens
section, and selects the third member of that section. If
the number 2583 is disengaged, the connector switch now
sends current from the central battery to this instrument,
thus ringing its bell, and it also supplies speaking current
to the two lines during the conversation, restores the
exchange mechanism to its original condition as soon as
the conversation is ended and the subscribers have hung
up their receivers, and registers the call on the calling
subscriber’s meter. If the connector finds the number
engaged, it sends out an intermittent buzzing sound, to
inform the caller of the fact. All these operations take
time to describe, even in outline, but in practice they are
carried out with the utmost rapidity, each step in the connecting-up
process taking only a small fraction of a second.</p>

<p>For ordinary local calls the automatic system requires
no operators at all, but for the convenience of users there
are usually two clerks at the exchange, one to give
any information required by subscribers, and the other to
record complaints regarding faulty working. For trunk
calls, the subscriber places his finger in the hole marked 0,
and gives the dial one turn. This connects him to an
operator at the trunk switchboard, who makes the required
connexion and then calls him up in the usual way.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the complex mechanism of an
automatic exchange would constantly be getting out of
order, but it is found to work with great smoothness.
Each automatic switchboard has a skilled electrician in
attendance, and he is informed instantly of any faulty
working by means of supervisory lamps and other signals.
Even without these signals the attendant would be quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
aware of any breakdown, for his ear becomes so accustomed
to the sounds made by the apparatus during the connecting-up,
that any abnormal sound due to faulty connecting
attracts his attention at once. However detected, the
faults are put right immediately, and it often happens that
a defective line is noted and repaired before the subscriber
knows that anything is wrong.</p>

<p>On account of its high speed in making connexions
and disconnexions, its absolute accuracy, and its privacy,
the automatic telephone system has proved most popular
wherever it has been given a fair trial. Its advantages are
most obvious in large city exchanges where the traffic
during business hours is tremendously heavy, and it is
probable that before very long the automatic system will
have replaced manual methods for all such exchanges.</p>

<p>The telephone system is more highly developed in the
United States than in this country, and some of the
exchanges have been made to do a great deal more than
simply transmit messages. For instance, in Chicago there
is a system by which a subscriber, on connecting himself to
a special circuit, is automatically informed of the correct
time, by means of phonographs, between the hours of 8
a.m. and 10 p.m. New York goes further than this however,
and has a regular system of news circulation by telephone.
According to <cite>Electricity</cite>, the daily programme is
as follows: “8 a.m., exact astronomical time; 8 to 9 a.m.,
weather reports, London Stock Exchange news, special
news item; 9 to 9.30 a.m., sales, amusements, business
events; 9.45 to 10 a.m., personal news, small notices; 10
to 10.30 a.m., New York Stock Exchange and market
news; 11.30 a.m. to 12 noon, local news, miscellaneous;
12 noon, exact astronomical time, latest telegrams, military
and parliamentary news; 2 to 2.15 p.m., European cables;
1.15 to 2.30 p.m., Washington news; 2.30 to 2.45 p.m.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
fashions, ladies’ news; 2.45 to 3.15 p.m., sporting and
theatrical news; 3.15 to 3.30 p.m., closing news from Wall
Street; 3.30 to 5 p.m., musical news, recitals, etc.; 5 to 6
p.m., feuilleton sketches, literary news; 8 to 10.30 p.m.,
selected evening performance—music, opera, recitations.”
Considering the elaborate nature of this scheme one might
imagine that the subscription would be high, but as a
matter of fact it is only six shillings per month.</p>

<p>The telephone has proved of great value in mine rescue
work, in providing means of communication between the
rescue party and those in the rear. This end is achieved
by means of a portable telephone, but as the members of a
rescue party often wear oxygen helmets, the ordinary telephone
mouthpiece is of no use. To overcome this difficulty
the transmitter is fastened round the throat. The vibrations
of the vocal cords pass through the wall of the throat,
and thus operate the transmitter. The receiver is fixed
over one ear by means of suitable head-gear, and the connecting
wire is laid by the advancing rescuers. A case
containing some hundreds of feet of wire is strapped round
the waist, and as the wearer walks forward this wire pays
itself out automatically.</p>

<p>By the time that the telephone came to be a really
practical instrument, capable of communicating over long
distances on land, the Atlantic telegraph cable was in
operation, and an attempt was made to telephone from one
continent to the other by means of it, but without success.
In speaking of submarine telegraphy in <a href="#chapter_XVII" class="pginternal">Chapter XVII</a>. we
saw that the cable acts like a Leyden jar, and it was this
fact that made it impossible to telephone through more than
about 20 miles of cable, so that transatlantic telephony
was quite out of the question. It was evident that little
progress could be made in this direction unless some means
could be devised for neutralizing this capacity effect, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
is called, of the cable, and finally it was discovered that
this could be done by inserting at intervals along the cable
a number of coils of wire. These coils are known as “loading
coils,” and a cable provided with them is called a “loaded
cable.” Such cables have been laid across various narrow
seas, such as between England and France, and England
and Ireland, and these have proved very successful for
telephonic communication. The problem of transatlantic
telephony however still remains to be solved. Experiments
have been made in submarine telephony over a bare
iron cable, instead of the usual insulated cable. Conversations
have been carried on in this way without difficulty
between Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., and Vashon
Island, a total distance of about 11 miles, and it is
possible that uninsulated cables may play an extremely
important part in the development of submarine telephony.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME TELEGRAPHIC AND TELEPHONIC INVENTIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> telegraphy messages not only may be received, but also
recorded, by the Morse printer or one of its modifications,
but in ordinary telephony there is no mechanical method of
recording messages. This means that we can communicate
by telephone only when we can call up somebody to receive
the message at the other end, and if no one happens to be
within hearing of the telephone bell we are quite helpless.
This is always annoying, and if the message is urgent the
delay may be serious. Several arrangements for overcoming
this difficulty by means of automatic recording
mechanism have been invented, but the only really successful
one is the telegraphone.</p>

<p>This instrument is the invention of Waldemar Poulsen,
whose apparatus for wireless telegraphy we shall speak of
in the next chapter. The telegraphone performs at the
same time the work of a telephone and of a phonograph.
In the ordinary type of phonograph the record is made in
the form of depressions or indentations on the surface of a
cylinder of wax; these indentations being produced by a
stylus actuated by vibrations set up in a diaphragm by the
act of speaking. In the telegraphone the same result is
obtained entirely by electro-magnetic action. The wax
cylinder of the phonograph is replaced by a steel wire or
ribbon, and the recording stylus by an electro-magnet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
The steel ribbon is arranged to travel along over two
cylinders or reels kept in constant rotation, and a small
electro-magnet is fixed midway between the cylinders so
that the ribbon passes close above it. This magnet is
connected to the telephone line, so that its magnetism
fluctuates in accordance with the variations in the current
in the line. We have seen that steel retains magnetism
imparted to it. In passing over the electro-magnet the
steel ribbon is magnetized in constantly varying degrees,
corresponding exactly with the variations in the line current
set up by the speaker’s voice, and these magnetic impressions
are retained by the ribbon. When the speaker has
finished, the telephone line is disconnected, the ribbon is
carried back to the point at which it started, and the
apparatus is connected to the telephone receiver. The
ribbon now moves forward again, and this time it acts like
the speaker’s voice, the varying intensity of its magnetic
record producing corresponding variations in the strength
of the magnet, so causing the receiver diaphragm to reproduce
the sounds in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>The magnetic record made in this manner is fairly
permanent, and if desired it may be reproduced over and
over again. In most cases, however, a permanent record
is of no value, and so the magnetic impressions are
obliterated in order that the ribbon may be used to take
a new record. This can be done by passing a permanent
magnet along the ribbon, but it is more convenient to have
an automatic obliterating arrangement. This consists of
another electro-magnet fixed close to the recording magnet,
so that the ribbon passes over it before reaching the latter.
The obliterating magnet is connected with a battery, and
its unvarying magnetism destroys all traces of the previous
record, and the ribbon passes forward to the recording
magnet ready to receive new impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>For recording telephone messages the telegraphone is
attached to the telephone instrument, and by automatically
operated switches it is set working by a distant speaker.
It records all messages received during the absence of its
owner, who, on his return, connects it to his receiver, and
thus hears a faithful reproduction of every word. By
speaking into his instrument before going out, the owner
can leave a message stating the time at which he expects
to return, and this message will be repeated by the telegraphone
to anybody ringing up in the meantime. The
most recent forms of telegraphone are capable of recording
speeches over an hour in length, and their reproduction is
as clear as that of any phonograph, indeed in many respects
it is considerably more perfect.</p>

<p>Another electrical apparatus for recording speech may
be mentioned. This rejoices in the uncouth name of the
Photographophone, and it is the invention of Ernst
Ruhmer, a German. Its working is based upon the fact
that the intensity of the light of the electric arc may be
varied by sound vibrations, each variation in the latter
producing a corresponding variation in the amount of light.
In the photographophone the light of an arc lamp is passed
through a lens which focuses it upon a moving photographic
film. By speaking or singing, the light is made to vary in
brilliance, and proportionate effects are produced in the
silver bromide of the film. On developing the film a
permanent record of the changes in the light intensity is
obtained, in the form of shadings of different degrees of
darkness. The film is now moved forward from end to
end in front of a fairly powerful lamp. The light passes
through the film, and falls upon a sort of plate made of
selenium. This is a non-metallic substance which possesses
the curious property of altering its resistance to an electric
current according to the amount of light falling upon it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
the greater the amount of light, the more current will the
selenium allow to pass. The selenium plate is connected
with a telephone receiver and with a battery. As the film
travels along, its varying shadings allow an ever-changing
amount of light to pass through and fall upon the selenium,
which varies its resistance accordingly. The resulting
variations in the current make the receiver diaphragm give
out a series of sounds, which are exact reproductions of the
original sounds made by the voice. The reproduction of
speech by the photographophone is quite good, but as a
rule it is not so perfect as with the telegraphone.</p>

<p>About ten years ago a German inventor, Professor A.
Korn, brought out the first really practical method of
telegraphing drawings or photographs. This invention is
remarkable not only for what it accomplishes, but perhaps
still more for the ingenuity with which the many peculiar
difficulties of the process are overcome. Like the photographophone,
Korn’s photo-telegraphic apparatus utilizes
the power of selenium to alter its resistance with the amount
of light reaching it.</p>

<p>Almost everybody is familiar with the terms “positive”
and “negative” as used in photography. The finished paper
print is a positive, with light and shade in the correct
positions; while the glass plate from which the print is made
is a negative, with light and shade reversed. The lantern
slide also is a positive, and it is exactly like the paper print,
except that it has a base of glass instead of paper, so that
it is transparent. Similarly, a positive may be made on a
piece of celluloid, and this, besides being transparent, is
flexible. The first step in transmitting on the Korn system
is to make from the photograph to be telegraphed a positive
of this kind, both transparent and flexible. This is bent
round a glass drum or cylinder, and fixed so that it cannot
possibly move. The cylinder is given a twofold movement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
It is rotated by means of an electric motor, and at
the same time it is made to travel slowly along in the
direction of its length. In fact its movement is very
similar to that of a screw, which turns round and moves
forward at the same time. A powerful beam of light is
concentrated upon the positive. This beam remains
stationary, but owing to the dual movement of the cylinder
it passes over every part of the positive, following a spiral
path. Exactly the same effect would be produced by
keeping the cylinder still and moving the beam spirally
round it, but this arrangement would be more difficult to
manipulate. The forward movement of the cylinder is
extremely small, so that the spiral is as fine as it is possible
to get it without having adjacent lines actually touching.
The light passes through the positive into the cylinder, and
is reflected towards a selenium cell; and as the positive
has an almost infinite number of gradations of tone, or
degrees of light and shade, the amount of light reaching
the cell varies constantly all the time. The selenium
therefore alters its resistance, and allows a constantly
varying current to pass through it, and so to the transmission
line.</p>

<p>At the receiving end is another cylinder having the
same rotating and forward movement, and round this is
fixed a sensitive photographic film. This film is protected
by a screen having a small opening, and no light can reach
it except through this aperture. The incoming current is
made to control a beam of light focused to fall upon the
screen aperture, the amount of light varying according to
the amount of current. In this way the beam of light, like
the one at the transmitting end, traces a spiral from end to
end of the film, and on developing the film a reproduction
of the original photograph is obtained. The telegraphed
photograph is thus made up of an enormous number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
of lines side by side, but these are so close to one
another that they are scarcely noticed, and the effect is
something like that of a rather coarse-grained ordinary
photograph.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the success of this method depends
upon the maintaining of absolute uniformity in the motion
of the two cylinders, and this is managed in a very ingenious
way. It will be remembered that one method of securing
uniformity in a number of sub-clocks under the control of
a master-clock is that of adjusting the sub-clocks to go a
little faster than the master-clock. Then, when the sub-clocks
reach the hour, they are held back by electro-magnetic
action until the master-clock arrives at the hour,
when all proceed together.</p>

<p>A similar method is employed for the cylinders. They
are driven by electric motors, and the motor at the receiving
end is adjusted so as to run very slightly faster
than the motor at the sending end. The result is that
the receiving cylinder completes one revolution a minute
fraction of a second before the transmitting cylinder. It
is then automatically held back until the sending cylinder
completes its revolution, and then both commence the next
revolution exactly together. The pause made by the
receiving cylinder is of extremely short duration, but in
order that there shall be no break in the spiral traced by
light upon the film, the pause takes place at the point
where the ends of the film come together. In actual
practice certain other details of adjustment are required
to ensure precision in working, but the main features of
the process are as described.</p>

<p>Although the above photo-telegraphic process is very
satisfactory in working, it has been superseded to some
extent by another process of a quite different nature. By
copying the original photograph through a glass screen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
covered with a multitude of very fine parallel lines, a half-tone
reproduction is made. This is formed of an immense
number of light and dark lines of varying breadth, and it
is printed in non-conducting ink on lead-foil, so that while
the dark lines are bare foil, the light ones are covered with
the ink. This half-tone is placed round a metal cylinder
having the same movement as the cylinders in the previous
processes, and a metal point, or “stylus” as it is called, is
made to rest lightly upon the foil picture, so that it travels
all over it, from one end to the other. An electrical circuit
is arranged so that when the stylus touches a piece of the
bare foil a current is sent out along the line wire. This
current is therefore intermittent, being interrupted each
time the stylus passes over a part of the half-tone picture
covered with the non-conducting ink, the succeeding
periods of current and no current varying with the breadth
of the conducting and the non-conducting lines. This
intermittent current goes to a similar arrangement of
stylus and cylinder at the receiving end, this cylinder
having round it a sheet of paper coated with a chemical
preparation. The coating is white all over to begin with,
but it turns black wherever the current passes through it.
The final result is that the intermittent current builds up
a reproduction in black-and-white of the original photograph.
In this process also the cylinders have to be
“synchronized,” or adjusted to run at the same speed.
Both this process and the foregoing one have been used
successfully for the transmission of press photographs,
notably by the <cite>Daily Mirror</cite>.</p>

<p>Professor Korn has carried out some interesting and
fairly successful experiments in wireless transmission of
photographs, but as yet the wireless results are considerably
inferior to those obtained with a line conductor. For
transmitting black-and-white pictures, line drawings, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
autographs by wireless, a combination of the two methods
just mentioned is employed; the second method being
used for sending, and the first or selenium method for
receiving. For true half-tone pictures the selenium method
is used at each end.</p>

<span class="subhead">WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AND TELEPHONY—PRINCIPLES AND APPARATUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Wireless</span> telegraphy is probably the most remarkable and
at the same time the most interesting of all the varied
applications of electricity. The exceptional popular
interest in wireless communication, as compared with most
of the other daily tasks which electricity is called upon
to perform, is easy to understand. The average man does
not realize that although we are able to make electricity
come and go at our bidding, we have little certain knowledge
of its nature. He is so accustomed to hearing of
the electric current, and of the work it is made to do, that
he sees little to marvel at so long as there is a connecting
wire. Electricity is produced by batteries or by a dynamo,
sent along a wire, and made to drive the necessary
machinery; apparently it is all quite simple. But take
away the connecting wire, and the case is different. In
wireless telegraphy electricity is produced as usual, but
instantly it passes out into the unknown, and, as far as
our senses can tell, it is lost for ever. Yet at some
distant point, hundreds or even thousands of miles away,
the electrical influence reappears, emerging from the
unknown with its burden of words and sentences. There
is something uncanny about this, something suggesting
telepathy and the occult, and herein lies the fascination of
wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>The idea of communicating without any connecting
wires is an old one. About the year 1842, Morse, of telegraph
fame, succeeded in transmitting telegraphic signals
across rivers and canals without a connecting wire. His
method was to stretch along each bank of the river a wire
equal in length to three times the breadth of the river.
One of these wires was connected with the transmitter and
with a battery, and the other with a receiver, both wires
terminating in copper plates sunk in the water. In this
case the water took the place of a connecting wire, and
acted as the conducting medium. A few years later
another investigator, a Scotchman named Lindsay, succeeded
in telegraphing across the river Tay, at a point
where it is over a mile and a half wide, by similar methods.
Lindsay appears to have been the first to suggest the possibility
of telegraphing across the Atlantic, and although at
that time, 1845, the idea must have seemed a wild one, he
had the firmest faith in its ultimate accomplishment.</p>

<p>Amongst those who followed Lindsay’s experiments
with keen interest was the late Sir William, then Mr.
Preece, but it was not until 1882, twenty years after
Lindsay’s death, that he commenced experiments on his
own account. In March of that year the cable across the
Solent failed, and Preece took the opportunity of trying to
signal across without a connecting wire. He used two
overhead wires, each terminating in large copper plates
sunk in the sea, one stretching from Southampton to
Southsea Pier, and the other from Ryde Pier to Sconce
Point. The experiment was successful, audible Morse
signals being received on each side. In this experiment,
as in those of Morse and Lindsay, the water acted as the
conducting medium; but a year or two later, Preece
turned his attention to a different method of wireless communication,
by means of induction. This method was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
based upon the fact that at the instant of starting and
stopping a current in one wire, another current is induced
in a second wire placed parallel to it, even when the two
wires are a considerable distance apart. Many successful
experiments in this induction telegraphy were made, one
of the most striking being that between the Island of Mull
and the mainland, in 1895. The cable between the island
and the mainland had broken, and by means of induction
perfect telegraphic communication was maintained during
the time that the cable was being repaired. Although this
system of wireless telegraphy is quite successful for short
distances, it becomes impracticable when the distance is
increased, because the length of each of the two parallel
wires must be roughly equal to the distance between them.
These experiments of Preece are of great interest, but we
must leave them because they have little connexion with
present-day wireless telegraphy, in which utterly different
methods are used.</p>

<p>All the commercial wireless systems of to-day depend
upon the production and transmission of electric waves.
About the year 1837 it was discovered that the discharge
of a Leyden jar did not consist of only one sudden rush of
electricity, but of a series of electric oscillations, which
surged backwards and forwards until electric equilibrium
was restored. This discovery was verified by later
experimenters, and it forms the foundation of our knowledge
of electric waves. At this point many readers probably
will ask, “What are electric waves?” It is impossible to
answer this question fully, for we still have a great deal to
learn about these waves, and we only can state the conclusions
at which our greatest scientists have arrived after
much thought and many experiments. It is believed that
all space is filled with a medium to which the name
“ether” has been given, and that this ether extends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
throughout the matter. We do not know what the ether
is, but the important fact is that it can receive and transmit
vibrations in the form of ether waves. There are different
kinds of ether waves, and they produce entirely different
effects. Some of them produce the effect which we call
light, and these are called “light waves.” Others produce
the effect known as heat, and they are called “heat waves”;
and still others produce electricity, and these we call
“electric waves.” These waves travel through the ether at
the enormous speed of 186,000 miles per second, so that
they would cross the Atlantic Ocean in about 1/80 second.
The fact that light also travels at this speed suggested that
there might be some connexion between the two sets of
waves, and after much experiment it has been demonstrated
that the waves of light and electricity are identical except
in their length.</p>

<p>Later on in this chapter we shall have occasion to refer
frequently to wave-length, and we may take this opportunity
of explaining what is understood by this term. Wave-length
is the distance measured from the crest of one wave
to the crest of the next, across the intervening trough or
hollow. From this it will be seen that the greater the
wave-length, the farther apart are the waves; and also that
if we have two sets of waves of different wave-lengths but
travelling at the same speed, then the number of waves
arriving at any point in one second will be greater in the
case of the shorter waves, because these are closer together.</p>

<p>A tuning-fork in vibration disturbs the surrounding air,
and sets up air waves which produce the effect called sound
when they strike against the drums of our ears. In a
similar way the discharge of a Leyden jar disturbs the
surrounding ether, and sets up electric ether waves; but
these waves produce no effect upon us in the shape of sight,
sound, or feeling. There is however a very simple piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
of apparatus which acts as a sort of electric eye or ear, and
detects the waves for us. This consists of a glass tube
loosely filled with metal filings, and having a cork at each
end. A wire is passed through each cork so as to project
well into the tube, but so that the two ends do not touch
one another, and the outer ends of these wires are connected
to a battery of one or two cells, and to some kind of
electrically worked apparatus, such as an electric bell. So
long as the filings lie quite loosely in the tube they offer
a very high resistance, and no current passes. If now
electric waves are set up by the discharge of a Leyden jar,
these waves fall upon the tube and cause the resistance
of the filings to decrease greatly. The filings now form a
conducting path through which the current passes, and so
the bell rings. If no further discharge takes place the
electric waves cease, but the filings do not return to their
original highly resistant condition, but retain their conductivity,
and the current continues to pass, and the bell
goes on ringing. To stop the bell it is only necessary
to tap the tube gently, when the filings immediately fall
back into their first state, so that the current cannot pass
through them.</p>

<p>Now let us see how the “coherer,” as the filings tube is
called, is used in actual wireless telegraphy. <a href="#fig_33" class="pginternal">Fig. 33<i>a</i></a>
shows a simple arrangement for the purpose. A is an
induction coil, and B the battery supplying the current.
The coil is fitted with a spark gap, consisting of two
highly polished brass balls CC, one of these balls being
connected to a vertical wire supported by a pole, and the
other to earth. D is a Morse key for starting and stopping
the current. When the key is pressed down, current flows
from the battery to the coil, and in passing through the
coil it is raised to a very high voltage, as described in
<a href="#chapter_VIII" class="pginternal">Chapter VIII</a>. This high tension current is sent into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
aerial wire, which quickly becomes charged up to its
utmost limits. But more current continues to arrive, and
so the electricity in the aerial, unable to bear any longer
the enormous pressure, takes the only path of escape and
bursts violently across the air gap separating the brass
balls. Surging oscillations are then produced in the aerial,
the ether is violently disturbed, and electric waves are
set in motion. This is the transmitting part of the
apparatus.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>If a stone is dropped into a pond, little waves are set in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
motion, and these spread outwards in ever-widening rings.
Electric waves also are propagated outwards in widening
rings, but instead of travelling in one plane only, like the
water waves, they proceed in every plane; and when they
arrive at the receiving aerial they set up in it oscillations
of the same nature as those which produced the waves.
Let us suppose electric waves to reach the aerial wire of
<a href="#fig_33" class="pginternal">Fig. 33<i>b</i></a>. The resistance of the coherer H is at once lowered
so that current from battery N flows and operates the relay
F, which closes the circuit of battery M. This battery
has a twofold task. It operates the sounder E, and it
energizes the electro-magnet of the de-coherer K, as shown
by the dotted lines. This de-coherer is simply an electric
bell without the gong, arranged so that the hammer strikes
the coherer tube; and its purpose is to tap the tube
automatically and much more rapidly than is possible by
hand. The sounder therefore gives a click, and the de-coherer
taps the tube, restoring the resistance of the
filings. The circuit of battery N is then broken, and the
relay therefore interrupts the circuit of battery M. If
waves continue to arrive, the circuits are again closed,
another click is given, and again the hammer taps the
tube. As long as waves are falling upon the aerial, the
alternate makings and breakings of the circuits follow one
another very rapidly and the sounder goes on working.
When the waves cease, the hammer of the de-coherer has
the last word, and the circuits of both batteries remain
broken. To confine the electric waves to their proper
sphere two coils of wire, LL, called choking coils, are
inserted as shown.</p>

<p>In this simple apparatus we have all the really essential
features of a wireless installation for short distances. For
long distance work various modifications are necessary,
but the principle remains exactly the same. In land wireless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
stations the single vertical aerial wire becomes an
elaborate arrangement of wires carried on huge masts and
towers. The distance over which signals can be transmitted
and received depends to a considerable extent upon
the height of the aerial, and consequently land stations
have the supporting masts or towers from one to several
hundred feet in height, according to the range over which
it is desired to work. As a rule the same aerial is used both
for transmitting and receiving, but some stations have a
separate aerial for each purpose. A good idea of the
appearance of commercial aerials for long distance working
may be obtained from the frontispiece, which shows the
Marconi station at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, from which
wireless communication is held with the Marconi station at
Clifden, in Galway, Ireland.</p>

<p>In the first wireless stations what is called a “plain
aerial” transmitter was used, and this was almost the same
as the transmitting apparatus in <a href="#fig_33" class="pginternal">Fig. 33<i>a</i></a>, except, of course,
that it was on a larger scale. This arrangement had many
serious drawbacks, including that of a very limited range,
and it has been abandoned in favour of the “coupled”
transmitter, a sketch of which is shown in <a href="#fig_34" class="pginternal">Fig. 34</a>. In this
transmitter there are two separate circuits, having the same
rate of oscillation. A is an induction coil, supplied with
current from the battery B, and C is a condenser. A
condenser is simply an apparatus for storing up charges of
electricity. It may take a variety of forms, but in every
case it must consist of two conducting layers separated by
a non-conducting layer, the latter being called the
“dielectric.” The Leyden jar is a condenser, with conducting
layers of tinfoil and a dielectric of glass, but the
condensers used for wireless purposes generally consist of
a number of parallel sheets of metal separated by glass or
mica, or in some cases by air only. The induction coil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
charges up the condenser with high tension electricity, until
the pressure becomes so great that the electricity is
discharged in the form of a spark between the brass balls
of the spark gap D. The accumulated electric energy in
the condenser then surges violently backwards and forwards,
and by induction corresponding surgings are produced in
the aerial circuit, these latter surgings setting up electric
waves in the ether.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>For the sake of simplicity we have represented the
apparatus as using an induction coil, but in all stations of
any size the coil is replaced by a step-up transformer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
the current is supplied either from an electric light power
station at some town near by, or from a power house specially
built for the purpose. Alternating current is generally used,
and if the current supplied is continuous, it is converted into
alternating current. This may be done by making the
continuous current drive an electric motor, which in turn
drives a dynamo generating alternating current. In any
case, the original current is too low in voltage to be used
directly, but in passing through the transformer it is raised
to the required high pressure. The transmitting key,
which is inserted between the dynamo and the transformer,
is specially constructed to prevent the operator from receiving
accidental shocks, and the spark gap is enclosed in a
sort of sound-proof box, to deaden the miniature thunders
of the discharge.</p>

<p>During the time that signals are being transmitted,
sparks follow one another across the spark gap in rapid
succession, a thousand sparks per second being by no
means an uncommon rate. The violence of these rapid
discharges raises the brass balls of the gap to a great heat.
This has the effect of making the sparking spasmodic and
uncertain, with the result that the signals at the receiving
station are unsatisfactory. To get over this difficulty
Marconi introduced a rotary spark gap. This is a wheel
with projecting knobs or studs, mounted on the shaft of the
dynamo supplying the current, so that it rotates rapidly.
Two stationary knobs are fixed so that the wheel rotates
between them, and the sparks are produced between these
fixed knobs and those of the wheel, a double spark gap
thus being formed. Overheating is prevented by the
currents of air set up by the rapid movement of the wheel,
and the sparking is always regular.</p>

<p>In the receiving apparatus already described a filings
coherer was used to detect the ether waves, and, by means
of a local battery, to translate them into audible signals with
a sounder, or printed signals with a Morse inker. This
coherer however is unsuitable for commercial working.
It is not sufficiently sensitive, and it can be used only for
comparatively short distances; while its action is so slow
that the maximum speed of signalling is not more than
about seventeen or eighteen words a minute. A number
of different detectors of much greater speed and sensitiveness
have been devised. The most reliable of these,
though not the most sensitive, is the Marconi magnetic detector,
<a href="#plate_XIIIb" class="pginternal">Plate XIII.<i>b</i></a>. This consists of a moving band made
of several soft iron wires twisted together, and passing close
to the poles of two horse-shoe magnets. As the band
passes from the influence of one magnet to that of the other
its magnetism becomes reversed, but the change takes a
certain amount of time to complete owing to the fact that
the iron has some magnetic retaining power, so that it
resists slightly the efforts of one magnet to reverse the
effect of the other. The moving band passes through two
small coils of wire, one connected with the aerial, and the
other with a specially sensitive telephone receiver. When
the electric waves from the transmitting station fall upon
the aerial of the receiving station, small, rapidly oscillating
currents pass through the first coil, and these have the
effect of making the band reverse its magnetism instantly.
The sudden moving of the lines of magnetic force induces
a current in the second coil, and produces a click in the
telephone. As long as the waves continue, the clicks
follow one another rapidly, and they are broken up into the
long and short signals of the Morse code according to the
manipulation of the Morse key at the sending station.
Except for winding up at intervals the clockwork mechanism
which drives the moving band, this detector requires no
attention, and it is always ready for work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>Another form of detector makes use of the peculiar
power possessed by certain crystals to rectify the oscillatory
currents received from the aerial, converting them into
uni-directional currents. At every discharge of the condenser
at the sending station a number of complete waves,
forming what is called a “train” of waves, is set in motion.
From each train of waves the crystal detector produces one
uni-directional pulsation of current, and this causes a click
in the telephone receiver. If these single pulsations follow
one another rapidly and regularly, a musical note is heard
in the receiver. Various combinations of crystals, and
crystals and metal points, are used, but all work in the
same way. Some combinations work without assistance,
but others require to have a small current passed through
them from a local battery. The crystals are held in small
cups of brass or copper, mounted so that they can be
adjusted by means of set-screws. Crystal detectors are
extremely sensitive, but they require very accurate adjustment,
and any vibration quickly throws them out of order.</p>

<p>The “electrolytic” detector rectifies the oscillating
currents in a different manner. One form consists of a thin
platinum wire passing down into a vessel made of lead,
and containing a weak solution of sulphuric acid. The
two terminals of a battery are connected to the wire and
the vessel respectively. As long as no oscillations are
received from the aerial the current is unable to flow
between the wire and the vessel, but when the oscillations
reach the detector the current at once passes, and operates
the telephone receiver. The action of this detector is not
thoroughly understood, and the way in which the point of
the platinum wire prevents the passing of the current until
the oscillations arrive from the aerial is something of a
mystery.</p>

<p>The last detector that need be described is the Fleming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
valve receiver. This consists of an electric incandescent
lamp, with either carbon or tungsten filament, into which
is sealed a plate of platinum connected with a terminal outside
the lamp. The plate and the filament do not touch
one another, but when the lamp is lighted up a current can
be passed from the plate to the filament, but not from filament
to plate. This receiver acts in a similar way to the
crystal detector, making the oscillating currents into uni-directional
currents. It has proved a great success for
transatlantic wireless communication between the Marconi
stations at Clifden and Glace Bay, and is extensively used.</p>

<p>The electric waves set in motion by the transmitting
apparatus of a wireless station spread outwards through
the ether in all directions, and so instead of reaching only
the aerial of the particular station with which it is desired
to communicate, they affect the aerials of all stations within
a certain range. So long as only one station is sending
messages this causes no trouble; but when, as is actually
the case, large numbers of stations are hard at work transmitting
different messages at the same time, it is evident
that unless something can be done to prevent it, each of
these messages will be received at the same moment by
every station within range, thus producing a hopeless confusion
of signals from which not a single message can be
read. Fortunately this chaos can be avoided by what is
called “tuning.”</p>

<p>Wireless tuning consists in adjusting the aerial of the
receiving station so that it has the same natural rate of
oscillation as that of the transmitting station. A simple
experiment will make clearer the meaning of this. If we
strike a tuning-fork, so that it sounds its note, and while it
is sounding strongly place near it another fork of the same
pitch and one of a different pitch, we find that the fork of
similar pitch also begins to sound faintly, whereas the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
fork remains silent. The explanation is that the two forks
of similar pitch have the same natural rate of vibration,
while the other fork vibrates at a different rate. When
the first fork is struck, it vibrates at a certain rate, and sets
in motion air waves of a certain length. These waves
reach both the other forks, but their effect is different in
each case. On reaching the fork of similar pitch the first
wave sets it vibrating, but not sufficiently to give out a
sound. But following this wave come others, and as the
fork has the same rate of vibration as the fork which
produced the waves, each wave arrives just at the right
moment to add its impulse to that of the preceding wave,
so that the effect accumulates and the fork sounds. In the
case of the third fork of different pitch, the first wave sets
it also vibrating, but as this fork cannot vibrate at the same
rate as the one producing the waves, the latter arrive at
wrong intervals; and instead of adding together their
impulses they interfere with one another, each upsetting
the work of the one before it, and the fork does not sound.
The same thing may be illustrated with a pendulum. If
we give a pendulum a gentle push at intervals corresponding
to its natural rate of swing, the effects of all these
pushes are added together, and the pendulum is made to
swing vigorously. If, on the other hand, we give the pushes
at longer or shorter intervals, they will not correspond with
the pendulum’s rate of swing, so that while some pushes
will help the pendulum, others will hinder it, and the final
result will be that the pendulum is brought almost to a
standstill, instead of being made to swing strongly and
regularly. The same principle holds good with wireless
aerials. Any aerial will respond readily to all other aerials
having the same rate of oscillation, because the waves in
each case are of the same length; that is to say, they follow
one another at the same intervals. On the other hand, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
aerial will not respond readily to waves from another aerial
having a different rate of oscillation, because these do not
follow each other at intervals to suit it.</p>

<p>If each station could receive signals only from stations
having aerials similar to its own, its usefulness would be
very limited, and so all stations are provided with means
of altering the rate of oscillation of their aerials. The
actual tuning apparatus by which this is accomplished need
not be described, as it is complicated, but what happens in
practice is this: The operator, wearing telephone receivers
fixed over his ears by means of a head band, sits at a
desk upon which are placed his various instruments. He
adjusts the tuning apparatus to a position in which
signals from stations of widely different wave-lengths are
received fairly well, and keeps a general look out over
passing signals. Presently he hears his own call-signal,
and knows that some station wishes to communicate with
him. Immediately he alters the adjustment of his tuner
until his aerial responds freely to the waves from this
station, but not to waves from other stations, and in this
way he is able to cut out signals from other stations and to
listen to the message without interruption.</p>

<p>Unfortunately wireless tuning is yet far from perfect in
certain respects. For instance, if two stations are transmitting
at the same time on the same wave-length, it is
clearly impossible for a receiving operator to cut one out
by wave-tuning, and to listen to the other only. In such
a case, however, it generally happens that although the
wave-frequency is the same, the frequency of the wave
groups or trains is different, so that there is a difference
in the notes heard in the telephones; and a skilful operator
can distinguish between the two sufficiently well to read
whichever message is intended for him. The stations
which produce a clear, medium-pitched note are the easiest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
to receive from, and in many cases it is possible to identify
a station at once by its characteristic note. Tuning is also
unable to prevent signals from a powerful station close at
hand from swamping to some extent signals from another
station at a great distance, the nearer station making the
receiving aerial respond to it as it were by brute force,
tuning or no tuning.</p>

<p>Another source of trouble lies in interference by atmospheric
electricity. Thunderstorms, especially in the
tropics, interfere greatly with the reception of signals,
the lightning discharges giving rise to violent, irregular
groups of waves which produce loud noises in the telephones.
There are also silent electrical disturbances in the
atmosphere, and these too produce less strong but equally
weird effects. Atmospheric discharges are very irregular,
without any real wave-length, so that an operator cannot
cut them out by wave-tuning pure and simple in the way
just described, as they defy him by affecting equally all
adjustments. Fortunately, the irregularity of the atmospherics
produces correspondingly irregular sounds in the
telephones, quite unlike the clear steady note of a wireless
station; and unless the atmospherics are unusually strong
this note pierces through them, so that the signals can be
read. The effects of lightning discharges are too violent
to be got rid of satisfactorily, and practically all that can
be done is to reduce the loudness of the noises in the
telephones, so that the operator is not temporarily deafened.
During violent storms in the near neighbourhood of a
station it is usual to connect the aerial directly to earth,
so that in the event of its being struck by a flash the
electricity passes harmlessly away, instead of injuring the
instruments, and possibly also the operators. Marconi
stations are always fitted with lightning-arresters.</p>

<p>The methods and apparatus we have described so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
are those of the Marconi system, and although in practice
additional complicated and delicate pieces of apparatus are
used, the description given represents the main features of
the system. Although Marconi was not the discoverer of
the principles of wireless telegraphy, he was the first to
produce a practical working system. In 1896 Marconi came
from Italy to England, bringing with him his apparatus,
and after a number of successful demonstrations of its
working, he succeeded in convincing even the most sceptical
experts that his system was thoroughly sound. Commencing
with a distance of about 100 yards, Marconi
rapidly increased the range of his experiments, and by
the end of 1897 he succeeded in transmitting signals
from Alum Bay, in the Isle of Wight, to a steamer 18
miles away. In 1899 messages were exchanged between
British warships 85 miles apart, and the crowning achievement
was reached in 1901, when Marconi received readable
signals at St. John’s, Newfoundland, from Poldhu in Cornwall,
a distance of about 1800 miles. In 1907 the Marconi
stations at Clifden and Glace Bay were opened for public
service, and by the following year transatlantic wireless
communication was in full swing. The sending of wireless
signals across the Atlantic was a remarkable accomplishment,
but it did not represent by any means the limits
of the system, as was shown in 1910. In that year
Marconi sailed for Buenos Ayres, and wireless communication
with Clifden was maintained up to the almost incredible
distance of 4000 miles by day, and 6735 miles by night.
The Marconi system has had many formidable rivals, but
it still holds the proud position of the most successful commercial
wireless system in the world.</p>

<p>We have not space to give a description of the other
commercial systems, but a few words on some of the chief
points in which they differ from the Marconi system may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
be of interest. We have seen that an ordinary spark gap,
formed by two metal balls a short distance apart, becomes
overheated by the rapid succession of discharges, with the
result that the sparking is irregular. What actually
happens is that the violent discharge tears off and vaporizes
minute particles of the metal. This intensely heated
vapour forms a conducting path which the current is able
to cross, so that an arc is produced just in the same way
as in the arc lamp. This arc is liable to be formed by
each discharge, and it lasts long enough to prevent the
sparks from following one another promptly. In the
Marconi system this trouble is avoided by means of a
rotating spark gap, but in the German “Telefunken”
system, so named from Greek <em>tele</em>, far off, and German
<i lang="de">Funke</i>, a spark, a fixed compound spark gap is used
for the same purpose. This consists of a row of metal
discs about 1/100 inch apart, and the spark leaps these
tiny gaps one after the other. The discs are about
3 inches in diameter, and their effect is to conduct away
quickly the heat of the discharge. By this means the
formation of an arc is prevented, and the effect of each
discharge is over immediately, the sparks being said to be
“quenched.” The short discharges enable more energy to
be radiated from the aerial into the ether, and very high
rates of sparking are obtained, producing a high-pitched
musical note.</p>

<p>The “Lepel” system also uses a quenched spark.
The gap consists of two metal discs clamped together and
separated only by a sheet of paper. The paper has a hole
through its centre, and through this hole the discharge
takes place, the discs being kept cool by water in constant
circulation. The discharge is much less noisy than in the
Marconi and Telefunken systems, and the musical note
produced is so sensitive that by varying the adjustments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
simple tunes can be played, and these can be heard quite
distinctly in the telephone at the receiving stations.</p>

<p>In the three systems already mentioned spark
discharges are used to set up oscillatory currents in the
aerial, which in turn set up waves in the ether. Each
discharge sets in motion a certain number of waves,
forming what is known as a train of waves. The discharges
follow one another very rapidly, but still there is a
minute interval between them, and consequently there is a
corresponding interval between the wave-trains. In the
“Goldschmidt” system the waves are not sent out in
groups of this kind, but in one long continuous stream.
The oscillatory currents which produce ether waves are
really alternating currents which flow backwards and
forwards at an enormous speed. The alternating current
produced at an ordinary power station is of no use for
wireless purposes, because its “frequency,” or rate of flow
backwards and forwards, is far too low. It has been
found possible however to construct special dynamos
capable of producing alternating current of the necessary
high frequency, and such dynamos are used in the
Goldschmidt system. The dynamos are connected directly
to the aerial, so that the oscillatory currents in the latter
are continuous, and the ether waves produced are continuous
also.</p>

<p>The “Poulsen” system produces continuous waves in
an altogether different manner, by means of the electric
arc. The arc is formed between a fixed copper electrode
and a carbon electrode kept in constant rotation, and it is
enclosed in a kind of box filled with methylated spirit
vapour, hydrogen, or coal gas. A powerful electro-magnet
is placed close to the arc, so that the latter is surrounded
by a strong magnetic field. Connected with the terminals
of the arc is a circuit consisting of a condenser and a coil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of wire, and the arc sets up in this circuit oscillatory
currents which are communicated to the aerial. These
currents are continuous, and so also are the resulting
waves.</p>

<p>The method of signalling employed in these two
continuous-wave systems is quite different from that used
in the Marconi and other spark systems. It is practically
impossible to signal by starting and stopping the alternating-current
dynamos or the arc at long or short intervals to
represent dashes or dots. In one case the sudden changes
from full load to zero would cause the dynamo to vary its
speed, and consequently the wave-length would be
irregular; besides which the dynamo would be injured by
the sudden strains. In the other case it would be
extremely difficult to persuade the arc to start promptly
each time. On this account the dynamo and the arc are
kept going continuously while a message is being transmitted,
and the signals are given by altering the wave-length.
In other words, the transmitting aerial is thrown
in and out of tune alternately at the required long or short
intervals, and the receiving aerial responds only during the
“in-tune” intervals.</p>

<p>The various receiving detectors previously described
are arranged to work with dis-continuous waves, producing
a separate current impulse from each group or train of
waves. In continuous wave systems there are of course
no separate groups, and for this reason these detectors are
of no use, and a different arrangement is required. The
oscillatory currents set up in the aerial are allowed to
charge up a condenser, and this condenser is automatically
disconnected from the aerial and connected to the operator’s
telephones at regular intervals of about 1/1000 second.
Each time the condenser is connected to the telephones
it is discharged, and a click is produced. These clicks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
continue only as long as the waves are striking the aerial,
and as the transmitting operator interrupts the waves at
long or short intervals the clicks are split up into groups of
corresponding length.</p>

<p>Continuous waves have certain advantages over dis-continuous
waves, particularly in the matter of sharp
tuning, but these advantages are outweighed to a large
extent by weak points in the transmitting apparatus. The
dynamos used to produce the high-frequency currents in
the Goldschmidt system are very expensive to construct
and troublesome to keep in order; while in the Poulsen
system the arc is difficult to keep going for long periods,
and it is liable to fluctuations which greatly affect its
working power. Although all the commercial Marconi
installations make use of dis-continuous waves exclusively,
Mr. Marconi is still carrying out experiments with continuous
waves.</p>

<p>There are many points in wireless telegraphy yet to be
explained satisfactorily. Our knowledge of the electric
ether waves is still limited, and we do not know for certain
how these waves travel from place to place, or exactly
what happens to them on their journeys. For this reason
we are unable to give a satisfactory explanation of the
curious fact that, generally speaking, it is easier to signal
over long distances at night than during the day. Still
more peculiar is the fact that it is easier to signal in a
north and south direction than in an east and west
direction. There are also remarkable variations in the
strength of the signals at certain times, particularly about
sunset and sunrise. Every station has a certain normal
range which does not vary much as a rule, but at odd
times astonishing “freak” distances are covered, stations
having for a short time ranges far beyond their usual limits.
These and other problems are being attacked by many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
investigators, and no doubt before very long they will be
solved. Wireless telegraphy already has reached remarkable
perfection, but it is still a young science, and we may
confidently expect developments which will enable us to
send messages with all speed across vast gulfs of distance
at present unconquered.</p>

<p>Wireless telephony, like wireless telegraphy, makes use
of electric waves set up in, and transmitted through the
ether. The apparatus is practically the same in each case,
except in one or two important points. In wireless
telegraphy either continuous or dis-continuous waves may
be used, and in the latter case the spark-frequency may be
as low as twenty-five per second. On the other hand,
wireless telephony requires waves which are either
continuous, or if dis-continuous, produced by a spark-frequency
of not less than 20,000 per second. In other
words, the frequency of the wave trains must be well above
the limits of audibility. Although dis-continuous waves of
a frequency of from 20,000 to 40,000 or more per second
can be used, it has been found more convenient to use
absolutely continuous waves for wireless telephony, and
these may be produced by the Marconi disc generator, by
the Goldschmidt alternator, or by the Poulsen arc, the last
named being largely employed.</p>

<p>In wireless telegraphy the wave trains are split up by
a transmitting key so as to form groups of signals; but in
telephony the waves are not interrupted at all, but are
simply varied in intensity by means of the voice. All
telephony, wireless or otherwise, depends upon the production
of variations in the strength of a current of
electricity, these variations being produced by air vibrations
set up in speaking. In ordinary telephony with connecting
wires the current variations are produced by means of a
microphone in the transmitter, and in wireless telephony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
the same principle is adopted. Here comes in the outstanding
difficulty in wireless transmission of speech. The
currents used in ordinary telephony are small, and the
microphone works with them quite satisfactorily; but in
wireless telephony very heavy currents have to be employed,
and so far no microphone has proved capable of
dealing effectively with these currents. Countless devices
to assist the microphone have been tried. It was found
that one of the causes of trouble was the overheating of
the carbon granules, which caused them to stick together,
so becoming insensitive. To remedy this the granules
have been cooled in various ways, by water, gas, or oil, but
although the results have been improved, still the microphones
worked far from perfectly. Improved results
have been obtained also by connecting a number of
microphones in parallel. The microphone difficulty is
holding back the development of wireless telephony, and
at present no satisfactory solution of the problem is in
sight.</p>

<p>The transmitting and receiving aerials are the same as
in wireless telegraphy, and like them are tuned to the same
frequency. The receiving apparatus too is of the ordinary
wireless type, with telephones and electrolytic or other
detectors.</p>

<p>Wireless telephony has been used with considerable
success in various German collieries, and at the Dinnington
Main Colliery, Yorkshire. Early last year Marconi succeeded
in establishing communication by wireless telephony
between Bournemouth and Chelmsford, which are about
100 miles apart; and about the same time a song sung
at Laeken, in Belgium, was heard clearly at the Eiffel
Tower, Paris, a distance of 225 miles. The German
Telefunken Company have communicated by wireless
telephony between Berlin and Vienna, 375 miles, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
speech has been transmitted from Rome to Tripoli, a total
distance of more than 600 miles. These distances are of
course comparatively small, but if the microphone trouble
can be overcome satisfactorily, transatlantic wireless
telephony appears to be quite possible.</p>

<span class="subhead">WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY—PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A fairly</span> good idea of the principles and apparatus of wireless
telegraphy should have been gained in reading <a href="#chapter_XX" class="pginternal">Chapter
XX</a>., but so far little has been said about its practical use.
If we leave their power out of consideration, wireless
stations may be divided into two classes: fixed stations on
land, and moving stations, if the expression may be allowed,
on ships. For moving stations wireless telegraphy has
the field all to itself, but for communication between fixed
stations it comes into conflict with ordinary telegraphy by
wire or cable. As regards land messages over comparatively
short distances, say throughout Great Britain, wireless
telegraphy has no advantages over the older methods; and
it is extremely unlikely that it ever will be substituted
for the existing cable telegraphy. For long distances
overland wireless has the great advantage of having all its
apparatus concentrated at two points. A long land line
passing through wild country, and exposed to all kinds of
weather, requires constant labour to keep it in good repair,
and when a breakdown occurs at any point, the repairing
gang may be miles away, so that delay is caused. On the
other hand, whatever may go wrong at a wireless station,
no time is lost in effecting the necessary repairs, for everything
is on the spot.</p>

<p>At present there is no great competition between wireless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and ordinary telegraphy for overland messages of any
kind, but the case is different when we come to communication
across seas and oceans. Already the cable companies have
been affected considerably, and there is little doubt that
they will feel the competition much more seriously before
long. The general public, always conservative in such
matters, have not yet grasped the fact that telegrams can
be handed in at any telegraph office in the British Isles,
and at most telegraph offices in the United States and
Canada, for wireless transmission across the Atlantic, via
the Marconi stations at Clifden and Glace Bay. The cost
is remarkably small, being eightpence a word for ordinary
messages.</p>

<p>It is impossible to state with any accuracy how many
land wireless stations there are in the world, but the list
given in the <cite>Year-Book of Wireless Telegraphy</cite> for 1915
enumerates about 700 stations. This list does not include
private or experimental stations, and also many stations
used exclusively for naval or military purposes are not
given. The information available about these 700 stations
is incomplete in many cases, but about 500 are controlled
by various departments of the governments of the different
states. Of the remainder, about 100 are controlled by the
Marconi Company, the rest being in the hands of various
wireless, commercial, or railway companies.</p>

<p>Amongst the most important land stations are the
Clifden and Glace Bay transatlantic stations. They are
very similar in plan, and each has a separate aerial for
sending and for receiving. Contrary to the usual practice,
continuous current is used to charge the condensers. In
<a href="#chapter_IV" class="pginternal">Chapter IV</a>. we saw how a current of high voltage could
be obtained by connecting a number of cells in series, and
at these stations the necessary high voltage is produced by
connecting a number of powerful dynamos in series, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
same principle. Along with the dynamos a huge battery
of accumulators, consisting of about 6000 cells, is used as
a sort of reservoir of current. These stations have a
normal range of considerably over 3000 miles. Last year
a large transmitting station was completed at Cefndu, near
Carnarvon. This station, which is probably the most
powerful in existence, is intended to communicate directly
with New Jersey, United States, as an alternative to the
Clifden-Glace Bay route.</p>

<p>Other powerful stations are Poldhu, in Cornwall, of
which we shall speak later; the French Eiffel Tower
station; the German station at Nauen, near Berlin, which
last year succeeded in exchanging messages with Windhoek,
German South-West Africa, a distance of nearly 6000
miles; and the extremely powerful station at Coltano, Italy.
France has three stations in West Africa with a night
range of 1600 miles; and Italy one in Somaliland with a
normal range of about the same distance. The recently
opened Chinese stations at Canton, Foochow, and Woosung
have a range of 1300 miles by night, and 650 miles by day.
With the fall of Tsingtau, China, Germany lost a wireless
station capable of signalling over 1350 miles at night.
Japan has six stations with a night range of over 1000
miles. Massawa, on the Red Sea, has a range of 1600
miles, and New Zealand has two stations with ranges of
1200 miles by day, and 2500 miles by night. Australia
has a large number of stations with a normal range of
about 500 miles. In the United States, which has a very
large number of stations, Arlington, Virginia, covers 1000
miles, and Sayville from 600 to 2300 miles. South
America has not many high-power stations, but Cerrito, in
Uruguay, has a range of about 1000 miles.</p>

<p>Until a thoroughly practical system of long-distance
wireless telephony is developed, wireless telegraphy will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
remain the only possible means of communication between
ships and shore, or between one ship and another, except
where the distance is so small that some method of semaphore
signalling can be used. In the days when wireless
was unknown, a navigator was thrown entirely upon his
own resources as soon as his vessel was out of sight of
land, for no information of any kind could reach him.
Even with a wireless installation on board, the captain of a
vessel still needs the same skill and watchfulness as of old,
but in the times of uncertainty and danger to which all
ships are liable, he often is able to obtain information which
may prevent disaster. In order to determine accurately
his position, a navigator requires to know the exact Greenwich
Mean Time, and he gets this time from his chronometers.
These are wonderfully reliable instruments, but
even they may err at times. To avoid the possibility of
mistakes from this cause, wireless time signals are sent out
at regular intervals by certain high-power stations, and as
long as a vessel is within range of one of these stations the
slightest variation in the chronometers may be detected
immediately. Amongst these stations are the Eiffel Tower,
giving time signals at 10 a.m. and at midnight; and Norddeich,
Germany, giving signals at noon and midnight.
These time signals have proved most useful also on land,
more particularly for astronomers and for explorers engaged
on surveying work.</p>

<p>In addition to time signals, other valuable information
is conveyed by wireless to ships at sea. A ship encountering
ice, or a derelict, reports its discovery to other ships
and to the shore stations, and in this way vessels coming
along the same route are warned of the danger in time to
take the necessary precautions. Weather reports are issued
regularly from various shore stations in most parts of the
world. The completeness of the information given varies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
a good deal with different stations, but in many cases it
includes a report of the existing state of the weather at a
number of different places, a forecast of the winds likely
to be encountered at sea, say at a distance of 100 miles
from land, and warnings of approaching storms, with
remarks on any special atmospheric conditions at the time
of sending. In Europe weather reports are issued daily
from the Admiralty station at Cleethorpes, the Eiffel Tower,
and Norddeich; and in the United States more than a
dozen powerful stations are engaged in this work.</p>

<p>Another valuable use of wireless is in carrying on the
work of lighthouses and lightships during snowstorms or
dense fogs, which the light cannot penetrate. So far not
much has been done in this direction, but the French
Government have decided to establish wireless lighthouses
on the islands outside the port of Brest, and also at Havre.
Automatic transmitting apparatus will be used, sending
out signals every few seconds, and working for periods of
about thirty hours without attention.</p>

<p>The improvement in the conditions of ocean travel
wrought by wireless telegraphy is very remarkable. The
days when a vessel, on passing out of sight of land, entered
upon a period of utter isolation, is gone for ever. Unless
it strays far from all recognized trade routes, a ship fitted
with a wireless installation is never isolated; and with the
rapidly increasing number of high-power stations both on
land and sea, it soon will be almost impossible for a vessel
to find a stretch of ocean beyond the reach of wave-borne
messages. The North Atlantic Ocean is specially remarkable
for perfection of wireless communication. For the
first 250 miles or so after leaving British shores, liners are
within reach of various coast stations, and beyond this
Poldhu takes up the work and maintains communication
up to about mid-Atlantic. On passing beyond the reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of Poldhu, liners come within range of other Marconi
stations at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Cape Race,
Newfoundland, so that absolutely uninterrupted communication
is maintained throughout the voyage. On many
liners a small newspaper is published daily, in which are
given brief accounts of the most striking events of the
previous day, together with Stock Exchange quotations and
market prices. This press news is sent out during the
night from Poldhu and Cape Cod. During the whole
voyage messages may be transmitted from ship to shore,
or from shore to ship, with no more difficulty, as far as the
public are concerned, than in sending an ordinary inland
telegram.</p>

<p>The transmitting ranges of ship installations vary
greatly, the range of the average ocean liner being about
250 miles. Small ships come as low as 50 miles, while a
few exceptional vessels have night ranges up to 1200 or
even 2500 miles. Although an outward-bound vessel is
almost always within range of some high-power shore
station, it is evident that it soon must reach a point beyond
which it is unable to communicate directly with the shore.
This difficulty is overcome by a system of relaying from
ship to ship. The vessel wishing to speak with the shore
hands on its message to some other vessel nearer to land
or with a longer range, and this ship sends forward the
message to a shore station if one is within its reach, and if
not to a third vessel, which completes the transmission.</p>

<p>The necessity for wireless installations on all sea-going
vessels has been brought home to us in startling fashion on
several occasions during the last few years. Time after
time we have read thrilling accounts of ocean disasters in
which wireless has come to the rescue in the most wonderful
way. A magnificent liner, with its precious human
freight, steams majestically out of harbour, and ploughs its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
way out into the waste of waters. In mid-ocean comes
disaster, swift and awful, and the lives of all on board are
in deadly peril. Agonized eyes sweep the horizon, but no
sail is in sight, and succour seems hopeless. But on the
deck of that vessel is a small, unpretentious cabin, and at a
desk in that cabin sits a young fellow with strange-looking
instruments before him. At the first tidings of disaster he
presses a key, and out across the waters speed electric
waves bearing the wireless cry for help, “S.O.S.,” incessantly
repeated. Far away, on another liner, is a
similar small cabin, and its occupant is busy with messages
of everyday matters. Suddenly, in the midst of his work,
comes the call from the stricken vessel, and instantly all
else is forgotten. No matter what the message in hand, it
must wait, for lives are in danger. Quickly the call is
answered, the position of the doomed ship received, and
the captain is informed. A few orders are hurriedly given,
the ship’s course is changed, and away she steams to the
rescue, urged on by the full power of her engines. In an
hour or two she arrives alongside, boats are lowered, and
passengers and crew are snatched from death and placed
in safety. This scene, with variations, has been enacted
many times, and never yet has wireless failed to play its
part. It is only too true that in some instances many
lives have been lost, but in these cases it is necessary to
remember that without wireless every soul on board might
have gone down. The total number of lives already saved
by wireless is estimated at about 5000, and of these some
3000 have been saved in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Ship aerials are carried from one mast to another, as
high up as possible. The transmitting and receiving
apparatus is much the same as in land stations, so that it
need not be described. In addition, most liners carry a
large induction coil and a suitable battery, so that distress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
signals can be transmitted even when the ordinary
apparatus is rendered useless by the failure of the current
supply. Most of the wireless systems are represented
amongst ship installations, but the great majority of vessels
have either Marconi or Telefunken apparatus.</p>

<p>Every wireless station, whether on ship or on shore, has
a separate call-signal, consisting of three letters. For
instance, Clifden is MFT, Poldhu MPD, Norddeich KAV,
s.s. <i>Lusitania</i> MFA, and H.M.S. <i>Dreadnought</i> BAU.
Glace Bay, GB, and the Eiffel Tower, FL, have two
letters only. In order to avoid confusion, different countries
have different combinations of letters assigned to them
exclusively, and these are allotted to the various ship
and shore stations. For example, Great Britain has all
combinations beginning with B, G, and M; France all
combinations beginning with F, and also the combinations
UAA to UMZ; while the United States is entitled to use
all combinations beginning with N and W, and the combinations
KIA to KZZ. There are also special signals to
indicate nationality, for use by ships, British being indicated
by - - — -, Japanese by — - — -, and so on.</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy apparently has a useful future in
railway work. In spite of the great perfection of present-day
railway signalling, no railway company is able to avoid
occasional accidents. Some of these accidents are due to
circumstances which no precautions can guard against
entirely, such, for instance, as the sudden breakage of some
portion of the mechanism of the train itself. In many cases,
however, the accident is caused by some oversight on the
part of the signalman or the engine-driver. Probably the
great majority of such accidents are not due to real carelessness
or inattention to duty, but to unaccountable freaks
of the brain, through which some little detail, never before
forgotten, is overlooked completely until too late. We all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
are liable to these curious mental lapses, but happily in most
cases these do not lead to disaster of any kind. The ever-present
possibility of accidents brought about in this way is
recognized fully by railway authorities, and every effort is
made to devise mechanism which will safeguard a train in
case of failure of the human element. The great weakness
of the ordinary railway system is that there is no reliable
means of communicating with the driver of a train except
by the fixed signals, so that when a train has passed one
set of signals it is generally beyond the reach of a message
until it arrives at the next set. On the enterprising
Lackawanna Railroad, in the United States, an attempt has
been made to remove this defect by means of wireless
telegraphy, and the experiment has been remarkably
successful. Wireless communication between moving
passenger trains and certain stations along the route has
been established, and the system is being rapidly developed.</p>

<p>The wireless equipment of the stations is of the usual
type, and does not call for comment, but the apparatus on
the trains is worth mention. The aerial, which must be
low on account of bridges and tunnels, consists of rectangles
of wire fixed at a height of 18 inches above the roof of
each car. These separate aerials are connected together
by a wire running to a small operating room containing a
set of Marconi apparatus, and situated at the end of one of
the cars. The earth connexion is made to the track rails,
and the current is taken from the dynamos used to supply
the train with electric light. With this equipment messages
have been transmitted and received while the train was
running at the rate of 70 miles an hour, and distances
up to 125 miles have been covered. During a severe
storm in the early part of last year the telegraph and
telephone lines along the railroad broke down, but
uninterrupted communication was maintained by wireless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
and the operations of the relief gangs and the snow-ploughs
were directed by this means. For emergency signalling
this system is likely to prove of enormous importance. If
signals are set wrongly, through some misunderstanding,
and a train which should have been held up is passed
forward into danger, it can be stopped by a wireless message
in time to prevent an accident. Again, if a train has a
breakdown, or if it sticks fast in a snow-drift, its plight and
its exact position can be signalled to the nearest station, so
that help may be sent without delay. The possibilities of
the system in fact are almost unlimited, and it seems not
unlikely that wireless telegraphy will revolutionize the
long-distance railway travelling of the future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_213"><a id="chapter_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br>

<span class="subhead">ELECTROPLATING AND ELECTROTYPING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> our chapter on the accumulator or storage cell we saw
that a current of electricity has the power of decomposing
certain liquids; that is to say, it is able to split them up
into their component parts. This power has given rise
to the important art of electroplating and electrotyping.
Electroplating is the process of depositing a coating of a
rarer metal, such as gold, silver, or nickel, upon the
surface of baser or commoner metals; and electrotyping is
the copying of casts, medals, types, and other similar
objects. The fact that metals could be deposited by the
decomposition of a solution by a current was known in the
early days of the voltaic cell, but no one seems to have
paid much attention to it. An Italian chemist published
in 1805 an account of his success in coating two silver
medals with gold, and some thirty years later Bessemer
transformed lead castings into fairly presentable ornaments
by coating them with copper, but commercial electroplating
may be said to have begun about 1840, when an
Englishman named Elkington took out a patent for the
process. Since then the processes of electroplating and
electrotyping have rapidly come more and more into use,
until to-day they are practised on a vast scale, giving employment
to thousands.</p>

<p>Electroplating on a small scale is a very simple affair.
A solution of the metal which it is desired to deposit is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
placed in a suitable vessel. Two metal rods are placed
across the top of this vessel, and from one of these is
suspended a plate of the same metal as that in the solution,
and from the other is hung the article to receive the
coating. The positive terminal of a voltaic battery is
connected to the rod supporting the plate, and the negative
terminal to the rod carrying the article to be plated. As
the current passes through the solution from the plate to the
article the solution is decomposed, and the article receives
a coating of metal. The solution through which the
current passes, and which is decomposed, is called the
<em>electrolyte</em>, and the terminal points at which the current
enters and leaves the solution are called <em>electrodes</em>. The
electrode by which the current enters the electrolyte is
called the <em>anode</em>, and the one by which it leaves is called
the <em>cathode</em>.</p>

<p>If we wish to deposit a coating of copper on, say, an
old spoon which has been dismissed from household service,
a solution of sulphate of copper must be made up and
placed in a glass or stoneware jar. Two little rods of
brass, copper, or any other good conductor are placed
across the jar, one at each side, and by means of hooks of
wire a plate of copper is hung from one rod and the spoon
from the other. The positive terminal of a battery of
Daniell cells is then connected to the anode rod which
supports the copper plate, and the negative terminal to
the cathode rod carrying the spoon. The current now
commences its task of splitting up the copper-sulphate
solution into pure copper and sulphuric acid, and depositing
this copper upon the spoon. The latter is very quickly
covered with a sort of “blush” copper, and the coating
grows thicker and thicker as long as the current is kept
at work. If there were no copper plate forming the anode
the process would soon come to a standstill, on account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the copper in the electrolyte becoming used up; but as it
is the sulphuric acid separated out of the electrolyte takes
copper from the plate and combines with it to form a
further supply of copper sulphate. In this way the strength
of the solution is kept up, and the copper anode becomes
smaller and smaller as the coating on the spoon increases
in thickness. It is not necessary that the anode should
consist of absolutely pure copper, because any impurities
will be precipitated to the bottom or mixed with the
solution, nothing but quite pure copper being deposited on
the spoon. At the same time if the copper anode is very
impure the electrolyte quickly becomes foul, and has to be
purified or replaced by new solution.</p>

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Small Electroplating Outfit.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>To nickel-plate the spoon we should require a nickel
plate for the anode and a nickel solution; to silver-plate it,
a silver anode and solution, and so on. <a href="#fig_35" class="pginternal">Fig. 35</a> shows at
simple but effective arrangement for amateur electroplating
in a small way.</p>

<p>Electroplating on a commercial scale is of course a
much more elaborate process, but the principle remains
exactly the same. <a href="#fig_36" class="pginternal">Fig. 36</a> shows the general arrangement
of a plating shop. It is obviously extremely important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
that the deposit on a plated article should be durable, and
to ensure that the coating will adhere firmly the article
must be cleaned thoroughly before being plated. Cleanliness
in the ordinary domestic sense is not sufficient, for
the article must be chemically clean. Some idea of the
care required in this respect may be gained from the fact
that if the cleaned surface is touched with the hand before
being plated, the coating will strip off the parts that have
been touched. The surfaces are first cleaned mechanically,
and then chemically by immersion in solutions of acids or
alkalies, the cleaning process varying to some extent with
different metals. There is also a very interesting process
of cleaning by electricity. The article is placed in a vat
fitted with anode and cathode rods, just as in an ordinary
plating vat, and containing a solution of hydrate of potash
and cyanide of potassium. The anode consists of a carbon
plate, and the article is hung from the cathode rod.
Sufficient current is passed through the solution to cause
gas to be given off rapidly at the cathode, and as this gas
rises to the surface it carries with it the grease and dirt
from the article, in the form of a dirty scum. After a
short time the article becomes oxidized and discoloured,
and the current is then reversed, so that the article becomes
the anode, and the carbon plate the cathode. The
current now removes the oxide from the surface of the
article, which is left quite bright and chemically clean.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;" id="fig_36">

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>—General Arrangement of an Electroplating Shop.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>When thoroughly cleaned the articles are ready to be
placed in the plating vats. These vats are usually made
of wood lined with chemically pure lead, or of iron lined
with enamel or cement. Anode and cathode rods made
of brass are placed across the vats, and from these the
anodes of the various metals and the articles to be plated
are hung by hooks of nickel or brass. Any number of
rods may be used, according to the size of the vat, so long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
as the articles have an anode on each side. If three rods
are used the articles are hung from the centre one, and the
anodes from the outside ones. If a number of small
articles are to be plated together they are often suspended
in perforated metal trays. Small articles are also plated
by placing them in a perforated barrel of wood, or wood
and celluloid, which revolves in the solution. While the
articles are being plated the revolving of the barrel makes
them rub one against the other, so that they are brightly
burnished. Dog chains, cycle chain links, button-hooks,
and harness fittings are amongst the articles plated by
means of the revolving barrel.</p>

<p>The strength of current required for different kinds of
plating varies considerably, and if the work is to be of the
best quality it is very important that the current should be
exactly right for the particular process in hand. In order
to adjust it accurately variable resistances of German silver
wire are provided for each vat, the current having to pass
through the resistance before reaching the solution. The
volume and the pressure of the current are measured by
amperemeters and voltmeters attached to the resistance
boards. If the intensity of the current is too great the
articles are liable to be “burnt,” when the deposit is dark
coloured and often useless.</p>

<p>When exceptionally irregular surfaces have to be plated
it is sometimes necessary to employ an anode of special
shape, in order to keep as uniform a distance as possible
between the electrodes. If this is not done, those parts of
the surface nearest the anode get more than their share of
the current, and so they receive a thicker deposit than the
parts farther away.</p>

<p>An interesting process is that known as “parcel-plating,”
by which decorative coatings of different coloured metals
can be deposited on one article. For instance, if it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
desired to have gold flowers on a silver brooch, the parts
which are not to be gilded are painted over with a non-conducting
varnish. When this varnish is quite dry the
brooch is placed in the gilding vat and the current sent
through in the usual way. The gold is then deposited only
on the parts unprotected by varnish, and after the gilding
the varnish is easily removed by softening it in turpentine
and brushing with a bristle brush. More elaborate
combinations of different coloured metals can be made in
the same way.</p>

<p>Sugar basins, cream jugs, ornamental bowls, cigarette
cases, and other articles are often gilded only on the inside.
The article is filled with gold solution and connected to the
cathode rod. A piece of gold wrapped in calico is attached
to the anode rod, suspended in the solution inside the
article, and moved about quickly until the deposit is of the
required thickness.</p>

<p>The time occupied in plating is greatly shortened by
stirring or agitating the solutions. This sets up a good
circulation of the liquid, and a continual supply of fresh
solution is brought to the cathode. At the same time the
resistance to the current is decreased, and more current
may be used without fear of burning. <a href="#fig_37" class="pginternal">Fig. 37</a> shows an
arrangement for this purpose. The solution is agitated by
compressed air, and at the same time the cathode rods are
moved backwards and forwards. Plating solutions are
also frequently heated in order to hasten the rate of
deposition.</p>

<p>When the plating process is complete, the articles are
removed from the vat, thoroughly swilled in water, and
dried. They are then ready for finishing by polishing and
burnishing, or they may be given a sort of frosted surface.
During the finishing processes the appearance of the articles
changes considerably, the rather dead-looking surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
produced by the plating giving place to the bright lustre
of the particular metal.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that an article which has been
plated and polished shows little defects here and there in
the deposit. In such a case it is not necessary to re-plate
the whole article, for the defects can be made good by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
process of “doctoring.” A piece of the same metal as that
forming the deposit is placed between two pieces of wood,
and a wire fastened to one end of it. At the other end
several thicknesses of flannel are wrapped round and
securely tied. This strip, which forms a miniature anode,
is connected to the anode rod of the plating vat, and the
article is connected to the cathode rod. The flannel is
saturated with the plating solution, and the strip is rubbed
gently over the defective places until the deposit formed is
as thick as that on the rest of the article. If the work is
done carefully the “doctored” portions cannot be distinguished
from the rest of the surface.</p>

<p>Electroplating may be employed to give ships’ plates
a coating of copper to prevent barnacles from sticking to
them. The work is done in sections by building up to the
side of the vessel a sort of vat of which the plate to be
coated forms one side. The plate is thus at the same time
the cathode and part of the vat.</p>

<p>So far we have spoken only of electroplating objects
made of metal. If we tried to copperplate a plaster cast
by simply suspending it as we did our spoon, we should
get no result at all, because the plaster is a non-conductor.
But if we sprinkle plumbago over the cast so as to give it
a conducting surface, we can plate it quite well. Practically
all materials can be electroplated, but if they are non-conductors
they must be given a conducting surface in the
way just described or by some similar means. Even
flowers and insects may be plated, and by giving them first
a coating of copper and then a coating of gold, delicately
beautiful results are obtained.</p>

<p>Electrotyping is practically the same as electroplating,
except that the coating is removed from the support on
which it is deposited. The process is largely used for
copying engraved plates for printing purposes. The plate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
is first rubbed over with a very weak solution of beeswax
in turpentine, to prevent the deposit from adhering to it,
and it is then placed in a copperplating vat and given a
good thick coating. The coating is then stripped off, and
in this way a reversed copy of the plate is obtained. This
copy is then replaced in the vat, and a coating of copper
deposited upon it, and this coating, when stripped off, forms
an exact reproduction of the original, with every detail
faithfully preserved. An engraved plate may be copied
also by making from it a mould of plaster or composition.
The surface of this mould is then rendered conducting by
sprinkling over it a quantity of plumbago, which is well
brushed into all the recesses, and a coating of copper
deposited on it. As the mould was a reversed copy of the
original, the coating formed upon it is of course an exact
copy of the plate. If the copy has to be made very quickly
a preliminary deposit of copper is chemically formed on the
mould before it is placed in the vat. This is done by
pouring on to the mould a solution of sulphate of copper,
and sprinkling iron filings over the surface. The filings
are then brushed down on to the face of the mould with a
fine brush, and a chemical reaction takes place, resulting in
the precipitation of copper from the solution. After the
filings have been washed away, the mould is placed in the
vat, and the deposition of copper takes place very rapidly.</p>

<p>Engraved copperplates are often nickel or steel-plated
to give their surface greater hardness, so that the printer
may obtain a larger number of sharp impressions from the
same plate. Stereotypes also are coated with nickel for a
similar reason.</p>

<p>Before the dynamo came into general use all electroplating
and electrotyping was done with current supplied
by voltaic cells, and though the dynamo is now used exclusively
in large plating works, voltaic cells are still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
employed for work on a very small scale. A cell which
quickly polarizes is quite useless for plating purposes, and
one giving a constant and ample supply of current is
required. The Daniell cell, which was described in
<a href="#chapter_IV" class="pginternal">Chapter IV</a>., is used, and so also is the Bunsen cell, which
consists of a porous pot containing strong nitric acid and a
carbon rod, placed in an outer stoneware vessel containing
dilute sulphuric acid and a zinc plate. The drawback to
this cell is that it gives off very unpleasant fumes. The
dynamos used for plating work are specially constructed to
give a large amount of current at very low pressure.
Continuous current only can be used, for alternating current
would undo the work as fast as it was done, making the
article alternately a cathode and an anode.</p>

<span class="subhead">INDUSTRIAL ELECTROLYSIS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> metal copper, as obtained from copper ore, contains
many impurities of various kinds. For most purposes
these impurities greatly affect the value of the copper, and
before the metal can be of much commercial use they must
be got rid of in some way. In the previous chapter, in
describing how to copperplate an old spoon, we saw that
the anode need not consist of pure copper, because in any
case nothing but the pure metal would be deposited upon
the spoon. This fact forms the basis of the important
industry of electrolytic copper refining. The process is
exactly the same as ordinary copperplating, except that
the cathode always consists of absolutely pure copper.
This is generally in the form of a sheet no thicker than
thin paper, but sometimes a number of suspended wires are
used instead. A solution of copper sulphate is used as
usual for the electrolyte, and the anode is a thick cast plate
of the impure copper. The result of passing a current
through the solution is that copper is taken from the anode
and carried to the cathode, the impurities falling to the
bottom of the vat and accumulating as a sort of slime. In
this way thick slabs of pure copper are obtained, ready to
be melted down and cast into ingots.</p>

<p>The impurities in the raw copper vary according to the
ore from which it is obtained, and sometimes gold and
silver are found amongst them. When the copper is known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
to contain these metals the deposit at the bottom of the
refining vats is carefully collected, and from it a considerable
quantity of gold and silver is recovered. It is
estimated that about half a million tons of copper are
refined every year. An immense amount of this pure
copper is used for electrical purposes, for making conducting
wires and cables, and innumerable parts of electric
appliances and machinery of all kinds; in fact it is calculated
that more than half of the copper produced all over the
world is used in this way.</p>

<p>A similar method is employed to obtain the precious
metals in a pure state, from the substance known as
“bullion”; which consists usually of an intermingling of
gold, silver, and copper, with perhaps also lead. Just as in
copper refining, the raw material is used as the anode, and
a strip of pure gold or silver, according to which metal is
required, as the cathode. A silver solution is used if
silver is wanted, and a gold solution if gold is to be
deposited.</p>

<p>The metal aluminium has come into general use with
surprising rapidity, and during the last twenty-five or
thirty years the amount of this metal produced annually
has increased from two or three tons to many thousands
of tons. Aluminium occurs naturally in large quantities,
in the form of alumina, or oxide of aluminium, but for a
long time experimenters despaired of ever obtaining the
pure metal cheaply on a commercial scale. The oxides of
most metals can be reduced, that is deprived of their oxygen,
by heating them with carbon; but aluminium oxide holds
on to its oxygen with extraordinary tenacity, and absolutely
refuses to be parted from it in this way. One process
after another was tried, without success, and cheap
aluminium seemed to be an impossibility until about 1887,
when two chemists, Hall, an American, and Héroult, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Frenchman, discovered a satisfactory solution of the
problem. These chemists, who were then scarcely out of
their student days, worked quite independently of one
another, and it is a remarkable fact that their methods,
which are practically alike, were discovered at almost the
same time. The process is an interesting mixture of
electrolysis and electric heating. An iron crucible containing
a mixture of alumina, fluorspar, and cryolite is
heated. The two last-named substances are quickly fused,
and the alumina dissolves in the resulting fluid. When
the mixture has reached the fluid state, electrodes made of
carbon are dipped into it, and a current is passed through;
with the result that oxygen is given off at the anode, and
metallic aluminium is produced at the cathode, in molten
drops. This molten metal is heavier than the rest of the
fluid, and so it falls to the bottom. From here it is drawn
off at intervals, while fresh alumina is added as required,
so that the process goes on without interruption. After
the first fusing of the mixture no further outside heat is
required, for the heat produced by the passage of the
current is sufficient to keep the materials in a fluid state.
Vast quantities of aluminium are produced in this way at
Niagara Falls, and in Scotland and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Most of us are familiar with the substance known as
caustic soda. The chemical name for this is sodium hydrate,
and its preparation by electrolysis is interesting. Common
salt is a chemical compound of the metal sodium and the
greenish coloured, evil smelling gas chlorine, its proper
name being sodium chloride. A solution of this in water
is placed in a vat or cell, and a current is sent through it.
The solution is then split up into chlorine, at the anode,
and sodium at the cathode. Sodium has a remarkably
strong liking for water, and as soon as it is set free from
the chlorine it combines with the water of the solution, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
a new solution of sodium hydrate is formed. The water
in this is then got rid of, and solid caustic soda remains.</p>

<p>Amongst the many purposes for which caustic soda is
used is the preparation of oxygen and hydrogen. Water,
to which a little sulphuric acid has been added, is split up
by a current into oxygen and hydrogen, as we saw in
<a href="#chapter_V" class="pginternal">Chapter V</a>. This method may be used for the preparation
of these two gases on a commercial scale, but more usually
a solution of caustic soda is used as the electrolyte. If the
oxygen and hydrogen are not to be used at the place where
they are produced, they are forced under tremendous
pressure into steel cylinders, and at a lantern lecture these
cylinders may be seen supplying the gas for the lime-light.
Although the cylinders are specially made and tested for
strength, they are covered with a sort of rope netting; so
that if by any chance one happened to burst, the shattered
fragments of metal would be caught by the netting, instead
of flying all over the room and possibly injuring a number
of people. A large quantity of hydrogen is prepared by
this process for filling balloons and military airships.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RÖNTGEN RAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the chapter on electricity in the atmosphere we saw that
whereas air at ordinary pressure is a bad conductor, its
conducting power increases rapidly as the pressure is
lowered. Roughly speaking, if we wish to obtain a spark
across a gap of 1 inch in ordinary air, we must have an
electric pressure of about 50,000 volts. The discharge
which takes place under these conditions is very violent,
and it is called a “disruptive” discharge. If however the
air pressure is gradually lowered, the discharge loses its
violent character, and the brilliant spark is replaced by a
soft, luminous glow.</p>

<p>The changes in the character of the discharge may be
studied by means of an apparatus known as the “electric
egg.” This consists of an egg-shaped bulb of glass, having
its base connected with an air-pump. Two brass rods
project into the bulb, one at each end; the lower rod being
a fixture, while the upper one is arranged to slide in and
out, so that the distance between the balls can be varied.
The outer ends of the rods are connected to an induction
coil or to a Wimshurst machine. If the distance between
the balls has to be, say, half an inch, to produce a spark
with the air at normal pressure, then on slightly reducing
the pressure by means of the air-pump it is found that a
spark will pass with the balls an inch or more apart. The
brilliance of an electric spark is due to the resistance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
air, and as the pressure decreases the resistance becomes
smaller, so that the light produced is much less brilliant.
If the exhaustion is carried still further the discharge
becomes redder in colour, and spreads out wider and wider
until it loses all resemblance to a spark, and becomes a
luminous glow of a purple or violet colour. At first this
glow seems to fill the whole bulb, but at still higher vacua
it contracts into layers of definite shape, these layers being
alternately light and dark. Finally, when the pressure
becomes equal to about one-millionth of an atmosphere, a
luminous glow surrounds the cathode or negative rod,
beyond this is dark space almost filling the bulb, and the
walls of the bulb between the cathode and the anode
glow with phosphorescent light. This phosphorescence is
produced by rays coming from the cathode and passing
through the dark space, and these rays have been given the
name of “cathode rays.”</p>

<p>Many interesting experiments with these rays may be
performed with tubes permanently exhausted to the proper
degree. The power of the rays to produce phosphorescence
is shown in a most striking way with a tube fixed in a
horizontal position upon a stand, and containing a light
cross made of aluminium, placed in the path of the rays.
This is hinged at the base, so that it can be stood up on end
or thrown down by jerking the tube. Some of the rays
streaming from the cathode are intercepted by the cross,
while others pass by it and reach the other end of the tube.
The result is that a black shadow of the cross is thrown on
the glass, sharply contrasted with those parts of the tube
reached by the rays, and which phosphoresce brilliantly.
After a little while this brilliance decreases, for the glass
becomes fatigued, and loses to a considerable extent its
power of phosphorescing. If now the cross is jerked down,
the rays reach the portions of the tube before protected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
the cross, and this glass, being quite fresh, phosphoresces
with full brilliance. The black cross now suddenly becomes
brilliantly illuminated, while the tired glass is dark in
comparison. If the tired glass is allowed to rest for a while
it partly recovers its phosphorescing powers, but it never
regains its first brilliance.</p>

<p>An even more striking experiment may be made with a
horizontal tube containing a tiny wheel with vanes of mica,
something like a miniature water-wheel, mounted on glass
rails. When the discharges are sent through the tube, the
cathode rays strike against the vanes and cause the little
wheel to move forward in the direction of the anode. Other
experiments show that the cathode rays have great heating
power, and that they are deflected by a magnet held close
to the tube.</p>

<p>For a long time the nature of these cathode rays was in
dispute. German physicists held that they were of the same
character as ordinary light, while English scientists, headed
by Sir William Crookes, maintained that they were streams
of extremely minute particles of matter in a peculiar fourth
state. That is to say, the matter was not liquid, or solid, or
gaseous in the ordinary sense, but was <em>ultra-gaseous</em>, and
Crookes gave it the name of <em>radiant matter</em>. Most of us
have been taught to look upon the atom as the smallest
possible division of matter, but recent researches have made
it clear that the atom itself is divisible. It is believed that
an atom is made up of very much more minute particles
called <em>electrons</em>, which are moving about or revolving all the
time with incredible rapidity. According to Sir Oliver
Lodge, if we imagine an atom of hydrogen to be as big as
an ordinary church, then the electrons which constitute it
will be represented by about 700 grains of sand, 350 being
positively electrified and 350 negatively electrified. It is not
yet definitely determined whether these electrons are minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
particles of matter charged with electricity, or whether they
are actually atoms of electricity. The majority of scientists
now believe that the cathode rays consist of a stream of
negative electrons repelled from the cathode at a speed of
124 miles per second, or not quite 1/1000 of the velocity of
light.</p>

<p>In November 1895, Professor Röntgen, a German
physicist, announced his discovery of certain invisible rays
which were produced at the same time as the cathode rays,
and which could penetrate easily solids quite opaque to
ordinary light. He was experimenting with vacuum tubes,
and he found that certain rays emerged from the tube. These
were not cathode rays, because they were able to pass
through the glass, and were not deflected by a magnet. To
these strange rays he gave the name of the “<em>X</em>,” or unknown
rays, but they are very frequently referred to by the name
of their discoverer.</p>

<p>It was soon found that the Röntgen rays affected an
ordinary photographic plate wrapped up in black paper so
as to exclude all ordinary light, and that they passed
through flesh much more easily than through bone. This
fact makes it possible to obtain what we may call “shadow-graphs”
of the bones through the flesh, and the value of
this to the medical profession was realized at once. The
rays also were found to cause certain chemical compounds
to become luminous. A cardboard screen covered with
one of these compounds is quite opaque to ordinary light,
but if it is examined when the Röntgen rays are falling
upon it, it is seen to be brightly illuminated, and if the
hand is held between the screen and the rays the bones
become clearly visible.</p>

<p>Röntgen rays are produced when the cathode rays fall
upon, and as it were bombard, an obstacle of some kind.
Almost any tube producing cathode rays will produce also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Röntgen rays, but special forms of tube are used when the
main object is to obtain these latter rays. <a href="#fig_38" class="pginternal">Fig. 38</a> shows
a typical form of simple X-ray tube. This, like all other
tubes for X-ray work, is exhausted to a rather higher
vacuum than tubes intended for the production of cathode
rays only. The cathode C is made of aluminium, and is
shaped like a saucer, its curvature being arranged so that
the cathode rays are focused on to the anti-cathode A.
The focusing as a rule is not done very accurately, for
although sharper radiographs are obtained when the cathode
rays converge exactly to a point on the anti-cathode, the
heating effect at this point is so great that a hole is quickly
burned. The target, or surface of the anti-cathode, is
made of some metal having an extremely high melting-point,
such as platinum, iridium, or tungsten. It has a flat
surface inclined at an angle of about 45°, so that the rays
emanating from it proceed in the direction shown by the
dotted lines in the figure. The continuous lines show the
direction of the cathode rays. The anode is made of
aluminium, and it is shown at N. It is not necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
have a separate anode, and the anti-cathode may be used
as the anode. In the tube shown in <a href="#fig_38" class="pginternal">Fig. 38</a> the anode
and the anti-cathode are joined by an insulated wire, so
that they both act as anodes. The tube is made of soda-glass,
as the X-rays do not pass at all readily through lead-glass.</p>

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>—Diagram of Mica Vacuum Regulator
for X-Ray Tubes.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The penetrating power of the X-rays varies with the
vacuum of the tube, a low vacuum giving rays of small
penetration, and a high vacuum rays of great penetration.
Tubes are called hard or soft according to the degree of
the vacuum, a hard
tube having a high
vacuum and a soft
tube a low one. It
should be remembered
that the
terms high and
low, as applied to
the vacuum of X-ray
tubes, are only
relative, because
the vacuum must
be very high to admit of the production of X-rays at all.
The vacuum becomes higher as the tube is used, and after a
while it becomes so high that the tube is practically useless,
for the penetrating power of the rays is then so great that
sharp contrasts between different substances, such as flesh
and bone, cannot be obtained, and the resulting radiographs
are flat and poor. The vacuum of a hard tube may be
lowered temporarily by gently heating the tube, but this is
not a very convenient or satisfactory process, and tubes are
now made with special arrangements for lowering the
vacuum when necessary. There are several vacuum-regulating
devices, and <a href="#fig_39" class="pginternal">Fig. 39</a> is a diagram of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
“Standard” mica regulator used in most of the well-known
“Muller” X-ray tubes. This consists of a small additional
bulb containing an electrode D carrying a series of mica
discs. A wire DF is attached to D by means of a hinged
cap. The vacuum is lowered while the discharges are
passing through the tube. The wire DF is moved towards
the cathode terminal B, and kept there for a few seconds.
Sparks pass between F and B, and the current is now
passing through the electrode D in the regulator chamber.
This causes the mica to become heated, so that it gives off
a small quantity of gas, which passes into the main tube
and so lowers the vacuum. The wire DF is then moved
well away from B, and after a few hours’ rest the tube, now
of normal hardness, is ready for further use.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the heating of the anti-cathode
caused by the bombardment of the cathode rays.
Even if these rays are not focused very sharply, the anti-cathode
of an ordinary tube becomes dangerously hot if
the tube is run continuously for a fairly long period, and
for hospital and other medical work on an extensive scale
special tubes with water-cooled anti-cathodes are used.
These tubes have a small bulb blown in the anti-cathode
neck. This bulb is filled with water, which passes down a
tube to the back of the target of the anti-cathode. By this
arrangement the heat generated in the target is absorbed
by the water, so that the temperature of the target can
become only very slightly higher then 212° F., which
is the temperature of boiling water, and quite a safe
temperature for the anti-cathode. In some tubes the rise
in temperature is made slower by the use of broken bits of
ice in place of water. <a href="#fig_40" class="pginternal">Fig. 40</a> shows a Muller water-cooled
tube, and <a href="#fig_41" class="pginternal">Fig. 41</a> explains clearly the parts of an X-ray
tube and their names.</p>

<p>An induction coil is generally used to supply the high-tension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
electricity required for the production of the Röntgen
rays. For amateur or experimental purposes a coil
giving continuous 4-inch or even 3-inch sparks will
do, but for medical work, in which it is necessary to take
radiographs with very short exposures, coils giving sparks
of 10, 12, or more inches in length are employed. An
electrical influence machine, such as the Wimshurst, may
be used instead of an induction coil. Very powerful
machines with several pairs of plates of large diameter,
and driven by an electric motor, are in regular use for
X-ray work in the United States, but in this country they
are used only to a very small extent. A Wimshurst
machine is particularly suitable for amateur work. If a
screen is to be used for viewing bones through the flesh a
fairly large machine is required, but for screen examination
of such objects as coins in a box, or spectacles in a case,
and for taking radiographs of these and other similar
objects, a machine giving a fairly rapid succession of sparks
as short as 2 inches can be used. Of course the exposure
required for taking radiographs with a machine as small as
this are very long, but as the objects are inanimate this
does not matter very much.</p>

<p>For amateur X-ray work the arrangement of the
apparatus is simple. The tube is held in the required
position by means of a wooden clamp attached to a stand
in such a way that it is easily adjustable. Insulated wires
are led from the coil or from the Wimshurst machine to the
tube, the positive wire being connected to the anode, and
the negative wire to the cathode. With a small Wimshurst
machine light brass chains may be used instead of wires,
and these have the advantage of being easier to manipulate.
For medical purposes the arrangements are more complicated,
and generally a special room is set apart for X-ray
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>If the connexions have been made correctly, then on
starting the coil or the machine the tube lights up. The
bulb appears to be sharply divided into two parts, the
part in front of the anti-cathode glowing with a beautiful
greenish-yellow light, while the part behind the anti-cathode
is dark, except for lighter patches close to the
anode. The Röntgen rays are now being produced. The
illumination is not steady like that of an electric lamp, but
it consists of a series of flickers, which, with powerful
apparatus, follow one another so rapidly as to give the
impression of continuity. If the connexions are wrong, so
that the negative wire goes to the anode instead of to the
cathode, the bulb is not divided in this way, but has
patches of light almost all over. As soon as this appearance
is seen the apparatus must be stopped and the connexions
reversed, for the tube is quickly damaged by passing the
discharge through it in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Having produced the X-rays, we will suppose that it
is desired to examine the bones of the hand. For this
purpose a fluorescent screen is required. This consists of
a sheet of white cardboard coated usually with crystals of
barium platino-cyanide. In order to shut out all light but
that produced by the rays, the cardboard is placed at the
larger end of a box or bellows shaped like a pyramid.
This pyramid is brought close to the X-ray tube, with its
smaller end held close to the eyes, and the hand is placed
against the outer side of the cardboard sheet. The outline
of the hand is then seen as a light shadow, and the very
much blacker shadow of the bones is clearly visible. For
screen work it is necessary to darken the room almost
entirely, on account of the feebleness of the illumination of
the screen.</p>

<p>If a radiograph of the bones of the hand is to be taken,
a very sensitive photographic plate is necessary. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
ordinary extra-rapid plate will do fairly well, but for the
best work plates made specially for the purpose are used.
The emulsion of an ordinary photographic plate is only
partially opaque to the X-rays, so that while some of the
rays are stopped by it, others pass straight through. The
silver bromide in the emulsion is affected only by those
rays which are stopped, so that the energy of the rays
which pass through the emulsion is wasted. If a plate is
coated with a very thick film, a larger proportion of the
rays can be stopped, and many X-ray plates differ from
photographic plates only in the thickness of the emulsion.
A thick film however is undesirable because it makes the
after processes of developing, fixing, and washing very
prolonged. In the “Wratten” X-ray plate the emulsion is
made highly opaque to the rays in a different and ingenious
manner. Salts of certain metals have the power of
stopping the X-rays, and in this plate a metallic salt of this
kind is contained in the emulsion. The film produced in
this way stops a far larger proportion of the rays than any
ordinary film, and consequently the plate is more sensitive
to the rays, so that shorter exposures can be given.</p>

<p>X-ray plates are sold usually wrapped up separately in
light-tight envelopes of black paper, upon which the film
side of the plate is marked. If there is no such wrapping
the plate must be placed in a light-tight envelope, with
its film facing that side of the envelope which has no folds.
The ordinary photographic double envelopes, the inner one
of yellow paper and the outer one of black paper, are very
convenient for this purpose. The plate in its envelope is
then laid flat on the table, film side upwards, and the
X-ray tube is clamped in a horizontal position so that the
anti-cathode is over and pointing towards the plate. The
hand is laid flat on the envelope, and the coil or machine is
set working. The exposure required varies so much with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the size of the machine or coil, the distance between the
tube and the plate, the condition of the tube, and the nature
of the object, that it is impossible to give any definite
times, and these have to be found by experiment. The
hand requires a shorter exposure than any other part of the
body. If we call the correct exposure for the hand 1, then
the exposures for other parts of the body would be
approximately 3 for the foot and the elbow, 6 for the
shoulder, 8 for the thorax, 10 for the spine and the hip,
and about 12 for the head. The exposures for such objects
as coins in a box are much less than for the hand. After
exposure, the plate is developed, fixed, and washed just as
in ordinary photography. <a href="#plate_XIV" class="pginternal">Plate XIV</a>. shows a Röntgen
ray photograph of a number of fountain pens, British and
foreign.</p>

<p>Prolonged exposure to the X-rays gives rise to a
painful and serious disease known as X-ray dermatitis.
This danger was not realized by the early experimenters,
and many of them contracted the disease, with fatal results
in one or two cases. Operators now take ample precautions
to protect themselves from the rays. The tubes
are screened by substances opaque to the rays, so that
these emerge only where they are required, and
impenetrable gloves or hand-shields, aprons, and face-masks
made of rubber impregnated with lead-salts are
worn.</p>

<p>X-ray work is a most fascinating pursuit, and it can be
recommended strongly to amateurs interested in electricity.
There is nothing particularly difficult about it, and complete
outfits can be obtained at extremely low prices, although it
is best to get the most powerful Wimshurst machine or
induction coil that can be afforded. As radiography is
most likely to be taken up by photographers, it may be
well to state here that any photographic plates or papers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
left in their usual wrappings in the room in which X-rays
are being produced are almost certain to be spoiled, and
they should be placed in a tightly fitting metal box or be
taken into the next room. It is not necessary for the
amateur doing only occasional X-ray work with small
apparatus to take any of the precautions mentioned in the
previous paragraph, for there is not the slightest danger in
such work.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRICITY IN MEDICINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">One</span> of the most remarkable things about electricity is the
immense number of different purposes for which it may be
used. We have already seen it driving trams and trains,
lighting and heating our houses, and carrying our messages
thousands of miles over land and sea, and now we come to its
use in medical work. In the minds of many people medical
electricity is associated with absolute quackery. Advertisements
of electric belts, rings, and other similar appliances
have appeared regularly for many years in our newspapers
and magazines, and constant exposures of the utter worthlessness
of almost all these appliances have produced the
impression that medical electricity is nothing but a bare-faced
fraud, while the disgusting exhibitions of so-called
electric healing which have been given on the music-hall
stage have greatly deepened this impression. This state
of things is very unfortunate, because electricity, in the
hands of competent medical men, is a healing agent of
wonderful potency. Still another source of prejudice
against electricity may be found in the fact that electric
healing is popularly associated with more or less violent
shocks. On this account nervously-sensitive people shrink
from the idea of any kind of electrical treatment. As a
matter of fact electric shocks have no healing value, but on
the contrary they are frequently harmful, and a very severe
shock to a sensitive person may cause permanent injury.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
No shocks whatever are given in electric treatment by
medical men, and indeed in the majority of cases the treatment
is unaccompanied by unpleasant sensations of any kind.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we spoke of the use of the
Röntgen or X-rays in examining the various bones of the
body. By means of the fluorescent screen it is quite easy
to find and examine fractures and dislocations, and many
of the diseases of the bones and joints can be seen and
recognized. Metals are opaque to the X-rays, and so the
screen shows plainly such objects as needles or bullets
embedded in the flesh. Sometimes people, especially
young children, swallow coins and other small metal articles,
and here again the X-rays will show the exact position of
the intruder. A particularly valuable application of the
rays is in the discovering and locating of tiny fragments of
metal in the eye, for very often it is quite impossible to do
this by ordinary observation. Most of these fragments are
of steel or iron, and they are most easily removed by means
of an electro-magnet. If the fragment is very small a
powerful magnet is used, one capable of supporting 500
or 600 lb.; but if it is fairly large a weaker magnet,
supporting perhaps 30 lb., must be employed, because
the forceful and rapid dragging out of a large body might
seriously damage the eye.</p>

<p>If the chest is examined by the Röntgen rays the lungs
are seen as light spaces between the clearly marked ribs,
and any spot of congestion appears as a darker patch. In
this way the early stages of consumption may be revealed,
and in pneumonia and other similar complaints valuable
information regarding the condition of the lungs can be
obtained. It is possible also to follow to a considerable extent
the processes of digestion. X-rays easily pass through ordinary
food, but if bismuth oxychloride, which is quite harmless,
is mixed with the food, the mixture becomes opaque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
to the rays, and so its course may be followed on the screen.
The normal movements of the food are well known, and an
abnormal halt is probably caused by an obstruction of some
kind, and thus the X-rays enable the physician to locate
the obstruction, and to form an opinion of its nature.</p>

<p>In our chapter on wireless telegraphy we saw that the
discharge of a Leyden jar takes the form of a number of
rapid oscillations backwards and forwards. These oscillations
take place at a rate of more than half a million per
second, but by the use of an apparatus called a “high frequency
transformer” the rate is increased to more than a
million per second. Electricity in this state of rapid oscillation
is known as high frequency electricity, and high frequency
currents are very valuable for some kinds of medical
work. The application of these currents is quite painless, and
but for the strange-looking apparatus the patient probably
would not know that anything unusual was taking place.
To some extent the effect maybe said to be not unlike that
of a powerful tonic. Insomnia and other troubles due to
disordered nerves are quickly relieved, and even such
obstinate complaints as neuritis and crippling rheumatism
have been cured. The treatment is also of great value in
certain forms of heart trouble. By increasing the strength
of the high frequency currents the tissues actually may
be destroyed, and this power is utilized for exterminating
malignant growths, such as lupus or cancer.</p>

<p>The heat produced by a current of electricity is made
use of in cauterizing. The burner is a loop of platinum
wire, shaped according to the purpose for which it is
intended, and it is used at a dull red heat. Very tiny
electric incandescent lamps, fitted in long holders of special
shape, are largely used for examining the throat and the
various cavities of the body.</p>

<p>In the Finsen light treatment electric light is used for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
a very different purpose. The spectrum of white light consists
of the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
and violet. Just beyond the violet end of the spectrum are
the ultra-violet rays. Ultra-violet light consists of waves
of light which are so short as to be quite invisible to the
eye, and Dr. N. R. Finsen, a Danish physician, made the
discovery that this light is capable of destroying bacterial
germs. In the application of ultra-violet rays to medical
work, artificial light is used in preference to sunlight; for
though the latter contains ultra-violet light, a great deal of
it is absorbed in passing through the atmosphere. Besides
this, the sun sends out an immense amount of radiant heat,
and this has to be filtered out before the light can be used.
The usual source of light is the electric arc, and the arc is
much richer in ultra-violet rays if it is formed between
electrodes of iron, instead of the usual carbon rods. The
light, which, in addition to the ultra-violet rays, includes
the blue, indigo, and violet parts of the spectrum, is passed
along a tube something like that of a telescope, and is
focused by means of a double lens, consisting of two
separate plates of quartz. Glass cannot be used for the
lens, because it is opaque to the extreme ultra-violet rays.
A constant stream of water is passed between the two
plates forming the lens, and this filters out the heat rays,
which are not wanted. In some forms of Finsen lamp an
electric spark is used as the source of light, in place of the
arc.</p>

<p>The most important application of the Finsen light is
in the cure of the terribly disfiguring disease called lupus.
This is a form of tuberculosis of the skin, and it is produced
by the same deadly microbe which, when it attacks
the lungs, causes consumption. In all but extreme cases
the Finsen light effects a remarkable cure. A number of
applications are necessary, each of half an hour or more;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
and after a time the disease begins to disappear, leaving
soft, normal skin. The exact action of the light rays is a
disputed point. Finsen himself believed that the ultra-violet
rays attacked and exterminated the microbe, but a
later theory is that the rays stimulate the tissues to such
an extent that they are enabled to cure themselves. As
early as the year 1899 Finsen had employed his light
treatment in 350 cases of lupus, and out of this number
only five cases were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The ultra-violet rays are said to have a very beneficial
effect upon the teeth. Experiments carried out in Paris,
using a mercury vapour lamp as the source of light, show
that discoloured teeth are whitened and given a pearly
lustre by these rays, at the same time being sterilized so
that they do not easily decay. The Röntgen rays are
used for the treatment of lupus, and more particularly for
deeper growths, such as tumours and cancers, for which
the Finsen rays are useless, owing to their lack of penetrating
power. The action of these two kinds of rays appears
to be similar, but the X-rays are much the more active of
the two.</p>

<p>Electricity is often applied to the body through water,
in the form of the hydro-electric bath, and such baths
are used in the treatment of different kinds of paralysis.
Electric currents are used too for conveying drugs into the
tissues of the body. This is done when it is desired to
concentrate the drug at some particular point, and it has
been found that chemicals can be forced into the tissues for
a considerable distance.</p>

<p>Dr. Nagelschmidt, a great authority on medical electricity,
has suggested the use of electricity for weight reducing.
In the ordinary way superfluous flesh is got rid
of by a starvation diet coupled with exercise, but in many
cases excessively stout people are troubled with heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
disorders and asthma, so that it is almost impossible for
them to undergo the necessary muscular exertion. By the
application of electric currents, however, the beneficial
effects of the gentle exercise may be produced without any
exertion on the part of the patient, and an hour’s treatment
is said to result in a decrease in weight of from 200 to 800
grammes, or roughly 7 to 27 ounces.</p>

<span class="subhead">OZONE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> great difference between the atmospheric conditions
before and after a thunderstorm must have been noticed
by everybody. Before the storm the air feels lifeless. It
does not satisfy us as we draw it into our lungs, and however
deeply we breathe, we feel that something is lacking.
After the storm the air is delightful to inhale, and it refreshes
us with every breath. This remarkable transformation
is brought about to a very large extent by ozone
produced by the lightning discharges.</p>

<p>As far back as 1785 it was noticed that oxygen became
changed in some way when an electric spark was passed
through it, and that it acquired a peculiar odour. No
particular attention was paid to the matter however until
about 1840, when Schönbein, a famous German chemist, and
the discoverer of gun-cotton and collodion, became interested
in it. He gave this strange smelling substance the name
of “ozone,” and he published the results of his experiments
with it in a treatise entitled, “On the Generation of
Ozone.” Schönbein showed that ozone could be produced
by various methods, chemical as well as electrical. For
instance, if a piece of phosphorus is suspended in a jar of
air containing also a little water, in such a manner that it
is partly in the water and partly out of it, the air acquires
the characteristic smell of ozone, and it is found to have
gained increased chemical energy, so that it is a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
powerful oxidizing agent. For a long time the exact
chemical nature of ozone could not be determined, mainly
because it was impossible to obtain the substance in
quantities sufficiently large for extensive experimental
research, but also on account of its extremely energetic
properties, which made it very troublesome to examine.
These difficulties were so great that investigators were in
doubt as to whether ozone was an element or a compound
of two or more elements; but finally it was proved that it
was simply oxygen in a condensed or concentrated state.</p>

<p>Apparently ozone is formed by the contraction of
oxygen, so that from three volumes of oxygen two volumes
of ozone are produced. In other words, ozone has one and
a half times the density of oxygen. Ozone has far greater
oxidizing power than oxygen itself; in fact it is probably
the most powerful of all oxidizing agents, and herein lies
its great value. It acts as nature’s disinfectant or sterilizer,
and plays a very important part in keeping the air pure,
by destroying injurious organic matter. Bacteria apparently
have a most decided objection to dying; at any
rate they take an extraordinary amount of killing. Ozone
is more than a match for them however, and under its
influence they have a short life and probably not a merry
one.</p>

<p>Ozone exists naturally in the atmosphere in the open
country, and more especially at the seaside. It is produced
by lightning discharges, by silent electrical discharges
in the atmosphere, by the evaporation of water,
particularly salt water, by the action of sunlight, and also
by the action of certain vegetable products upon the air.
The quantity of ozone in the air is always small, and even
pure country or sea air contains only one volume of ozone
in about 700,000 volumes of air. No ozone can be detected
in the air of large towns, or over unhealthy swamps or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
marshes. The exhilarating effects of country and sea air,
and the depressing effects of town air, are due to a very
large extent to the presence or absence of ozone.</p>

<p>A great proportion of our common ailments are caused
directly or indirectly by a sort of slow poisoning, produced
by the impure air in which we live and work. It is popularly
supposed that the tainting of the air of rooms in
which large numbers of people are crowded together is due
to an excessive amount of carbonic acid gas. This is a
mistake, for besides being tasteless and odourless, carbonic
acid gas is practically harmless, except in quantities far
greater than ever exist even in the worst ventilated rooms.
The real source of the tainted air is the great amount of
animal matter thrown off as waste products from the skin
and lungs, and this tainting is further intensified by the
absence of motion in the air. Even in an over-crowded
room the conditions are made much more bearable if the
air is kept in motion, and in a close room ladies obtain
relief by the use of their fans. What we require, therefore,
in order to maintain an agreeable atmosphere under
all conditions, is some means of keeping the air in gentle
motion, and at the same time destroying as much as possible
of the animal matter contained in it. Perhaps the
most interesting and at the same time the most scientific
method of doing this is by ozone ventilation.</p>

<p>In the well-known “Ozonair” system of ventilation,
ozone is generated by high-tension current. Low-tension
current is taken from the public mains or from accumulators,
and raised to a very high voltage by passing it through a
step-up transformer. The secondary terminals of the
transformer are connected to a special form of condenser,
consisting of layers of fine metal gauze separated by an
insulating substance called “micanite.” The high tension
between the gauze layers produces a silent electrical discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
or glow. A small fan worked by an electric motor
draws the air over the condenser plates, and so a certain
proportion of the oxygen is ozonized, and is driven out of
the other side of the apparatus into the room. The amount
of ozone generated and the amount of air drawn over the
condenser are regulated carefully, so that the ozonized air
contains rather less than one volume of ozone in one
million volumes of air, experiment having shown that this
is the most suitable strength for breathing. Ozone diluted
to this degree has a slight odour which is very refreshing,
and besides diminishing the number of organic germs in
the air, it neutralizes unpleasant smells, such as arise from
cooking or stale tobacco smoke. Ozone ventilation is now
employed successfully in many hotels, steamships, theatres
and other places of entertainment, municipal and public
buildings, and factories.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>One of the most interesting examples of ozone ventilation
is that of the Central London tube electric railway.
The installation consists of a separate ozonizing plant at
every station, except Shepherd’s Bush, which is close to
the open end of the tunnel. <a href="#fig_42" class="pginternal">Fig. 42</a> is a diagram of the
general arrangement of one of these plants, and it shows
how the air is purified, ozonized, and sent into the tunnel.
The generating plant is seen at the top left-hand corner of
the figure. Air is drawn in as shown by the arrows, and
by passing through the filter screen F it is freed from dirt
and smuts, and from most of the injurious gases which
always are present in town air. The filter screen is kept
moist by a continual flow of water from jets above it, the
waste water falling into the trough W. The ozone
generator is shown at O. Continuous current at about
500 volts, from the power station, is passed through a
rotary converter, which turns it into alternating current at
380 volts. This current goes to the transformer T, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
which it emerges at a pressure of 5000 volts, and is supplied
to the ozone generator. From the generator the strongly
ozonized air is taken by way of the ozone pipe P, to the
mixing chamber of the large ventilating fan M, where it is
mixed with the main air current and then blown down the
main air trunk. From this trunk it is distributed to various
conduits, and delivered at the air outlets marked A.
Altogether the various plants pump more than eighty
million cubic feet of ozonized air into the tunnels every
working day.</p>

<p>In many industries pure air is very essential, especially
during certain processes. This is the case in brewing, in
cold storage, and in the manufacture and canning of food
products; and in these industries ozone is employed as an
air purifier, with excellent results. Other industries cannot
be carried on without the production of very unpleasant
fumes and smells, which are a nuisance to the workers and
often also to the people living round about; and here
again ozone is used to destroy and remove the offending
odours. It is employed also in the purification of sewage
and polluted water; in bleaching delicate fabrics; in drying
and seasoning timber; in maturing tobacco, wines and
spirits, and in many other processes too numerous to
mention.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRIC IGNITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> petrol motor, which to-day is busily engaged all over
the world in driving thousands upon thousands of self-propelled
vehicles or automobiles, belongs to the important
class of internal-combustion engines. Combustion means
the operation of burning, and an internal-combustion engine
is one in which the motive power is produced by the combustion
of a highly explosive mixture of gases. In the
ordinary petrol motor this mixture consists of petrol and air,
and it is made by means of a device called a “carburetter.”
By suction, a quantity of petrol is forced through a jet with
a very fine nozzle, so that it is reduced to an extremely fine
spray. A certain proportion of air is allowed to enter, and
the mixture passes into the cylinder. Here it is compressed
by the rising piston so that it becomes more and more
heated, and at the right point it is ignited. Combustion
takes place with such rapidity that it takes the form of an
explosion, and the energy produced in this way drives
forward the piston, which turns the crank-shaft and so
communicates motion to the driving-wheels.</p>

<p>The part played by electricity in this process is confined
to the ignition of the compressed charge of petrol and air.
This may be done in two ways; by means of an accumulator
and a small induction coil, or by means of a dynamo driven
by the engine. At one time the first method was employed
exclusively, but to-day it is used as a rule only for starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
the car engine, the second or magneto method being used
when the engine has started up.</p>

<p>In accumulator ignition the low-tension current from
the accumulator passes through an induction coil, and is
thus transformed to high-tension current. This current
goes through a sparking plug, which is fixed in the head
of the cylinder. The sparking plug contains two metal
points separated by a tiny air gap of from about 1/30 to 1/50
inch. This gap provides the only possible path for the
high-tension current, so that the latter leaps across it in
the form of a spark. The spark is arranged to take place
when the piston is at the top of its stroke, that is, when the
explosive mixture is at its maximum compression, and the
heat of the spark ignites the mixture, the resulting explosion
forcing down the piston with great power. In practice it
is found better as a rule to cause the spark to pass very
slightly before the piston reaches the extreme limit of its
stroke. The reason of this is that the process of igniting
and exploding the charge occupies an appreciable, though
of course exceedingly small amount of time. Immediately
on reaching the top of its stroke the piston begins to
descend again, and if the spark and the top of the stroke
coincide in time the explosion does not take place until the
piston has moved some little distance down the cylinder,
and so a certain amount of power is lost. By having the
spark a little in advance of the piston, the explosion occurs
at the instant when the piston begins to return, and so the
full force of the explosion is utilized.</p>

<p>In magneto ignition the current is supplied by a small
dynamo. This generates alternating current, and it is
driven by the car engine. The current is at first at low
pressure, and it has to be transformed to high-tension
current in order to produce the spark. There are two
methods of effecting this transformation. One is by turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
the armature of the dynamo into a sort of induction coil, by
giving it two separate windings, primary and secondary;
so that the dynamo delivers high-tension current directly.
The other method is to send the low-tension current
through one or more transformer coils, just as in accumulator
ignition. Accumulators can give current only for a
certain limited period, and they are liable consequently to
run down at inconvenient times and places. They also
have the defect of undergoing a slight leakage of current
even when they are not in use. Magneto ignition has
neither of these drawbacks, and on account of its superior
reliability it has come into universal use.</p>

<p>In the working of quarries and mines of various kinds,
and also in large engineering undertakings, blasting plays
a prominent part. Under all conditions blasting is a more
or less dangerous business, and it has been the cause of
very many serious accidents to the men engaged in carrying
it out. Many of these accidents are due to the carelessness
resulting from long familiarity with the work, but apart
from this the danger lies principally in uncertainty in
exploding the charge. Sometimes the explosion occurs
sooner than expected, so that the men have not time to get
away to a safe distance. Still more deadly is the delayed
explosion. After making the necessary arrangements the
men retire out of danger, and await the explosion. This
does not take place at the expected time, and after waiting
a little longer the men conclude that the ignition has failed,
and return to put matters right. Then the explosion takes
place, and the men are killed instantly or at least seriously
injured. Although it is impossible to avoid altogether
dangers of this nature, the risk can be reduced to the
minimum by igniting the explosives by electricity.</p>

<p>Electrical shot firing may be carried out in different
ways, according to circumstances. The current is supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
either by a dynamo or by a battery, and the firing is controlled
from a switchboard placed at a safe distance from the point
at which the charge is to be exploded, the connexions being
made by long insulated wires. The actual ignition is
effected by a hot spark, as in automobile ignition, or by an
electric detonator or fuse. Explosives such as dynamite
cannot be fired by simple ignition, but require to be
detonated. This is effected by a detonator consisting of a
small cup-shaped tube, made of ebonite or other similar
material. The wires conveying the current project into this
tube, and are connected by a short piece of very fine wire
having a high resistance. Round this wire is packed a
small quantity of gun-cotton, and beyond, in a sort of continuation
of the tube, is placed an extremely explosive
substance called “fulminate of mercury,” the whole arrangement
being surrounded by the dynamite to be fired. When
all is ready the man at the switchboard manipulates a
switch, and the current passes to the detonator and forces
its way through the resistance of the thin connecting wire.
This wire becomes sufficiently hot to ignite the gun-cotton,
and so explode the fulminate of mercury. The explosion
is so violent that the dynamite charge is detonated, and
the required blasting carried out. Gunpowder and similar
explosives do not need to be detonated, and so a simple
fuse is used. Electric fuses are much the same as detonators,
except that the tube contains gunpowder instead of
fulminate of mercury, this powder being ignited through an
electrically heated wire in the same way. These electrical
methods do away with the uncertainty of the slow-burning
fuses formerly employed, which never could be relied upon
with confidence.</p>

<p>Enormous quantities of explosives are now used in
blasting on a large scale, where many tons of hard rock
have to be removed. One of the most striking blasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
feats was the blowing up of Flood Island, better known as
Hell Gate. This was a rocky islet, about 9 acres in
extent, situated in the East River, New York. It was a
continual menace to shipping, and after many fine vessels
had been wrecked upon it the authorities decided that it
should be removed. The rock was bored and drilled in all
directions, the work taking more than a year to complete;
and over 126 tons of explosives were filled into the borings.
The exploding was carried out by electricity, and the
mighty force generated shattered nearly 300,000 cubic
yards of solid rock.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRO-CULTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">About</span> thirty years ago a Swedish scientist, Professor
Lemström, travelled extensively in the Polar regions, and
he was greatly struck by the development of the Polar
vegetation. In spite of the lack of good soil, heat, and
light, he observed that this vegetation came to maturity
quicker than that of regions having much more favourable
climates, and that the colours of the flowers were remarkably
fresh and clear, and their perfumes exceptionally
strong. This was a surprising state of things, and
Lemström naturally sought a clue to the mystery. He
knew that peculiar electrical conditions prevailed in these
high latitudes, as was shown by the wonderful displays of
the Aurora Borealis, and he came to the conclusion that
the development of the vegetation was due to small currents
of electricity continually passing backwards and forwards
between the atmosphere and the Earth. On his return to
civilization Lemström at once began a series of experiments
to determine the effect of electricity upon the growth of
plants, and he succeeded in proving beyond all doubt that
plants grown under electrical influence flourished more
abundantly than those grown in the ordinary way.
Lemström’s experiments have been continued by other
investigators, and striking and conclusive results have been
obtained.</p>

<p>The air surrounding the Earth is always charged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
some extent with electricity, which in fine weather is
usually positive, but changes to negative on the approach
of wet weather. This electricity is always leaking away to
the earth more or less rapidly, and on its way it passes
through the tissues of the vegetation. An exceedingly
slow but constant discharge therefore is probably taking
place in the tissues of all plants. Experiments appear to
indicate that the upper part of a growing plant is negative,
and the lower part positive, and at any rate it is certain that
the leaves of a plant give off negative electricity. In dull
weather this discharge is at its minimum, but under the
influence of bright sunshine it goes on with full vigour. It
is not known exactly how this discharge affects the plant,
but apparently it assists its development in some way, and
there is no doubt that when the discharge is at its maximum
the flow of sap is most vigorous. Possibly the electricity
helps the plant to assimilate its food, by making this more
readily soluble.</p>

<p>This being so, a plant requires a regular daily supply of
uninterrupted sunshine in order to arrive at its highest
possible state of maturity. In our notoriously variable
climate there are many days with only short intermittent
periods of bright sunshine, and many other days without
any sunshine at all. Now if, on these dull days, we can
perform at least a part of the work of the sunshine, and
strengthen to some extent the minute currents passing
through the tissues of a plant, the development of this
plant should be accelerated, and this is found to be the
case. Under electrical influence plants not only arrive at
maturity quicker, but also in most cases their yield is
larger and of finer quality.</p>

<p>Lemström used a large influence machine as the source
of electricity in his experiments in electro-culture. Such
machines are very suitable for experimental work on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
small scale, and much valuable work has been done with
them by Professor Priestly and others; but they have the
great drawback of being uncertain in working. They are
quite satisfactory so long as the atmosphere remains dry,
but in damp weather they are often very erratic, and may
require hours of patient labour to coax them to start. For
this reason an induction coil is more suitable for continuous
work on an extensive scale.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory apparatus for electro-culture is
that used in the Lodge-Newman method, designed by Sir
Oliver Lodge and his son, working in conjunction with
Mr. Newman. This consists of a large induction coil
supplied with current from a dynamo driven by a small
engine, or from the public mains if available. This coil
is fitted with a spark gap, and the high-tension current goes
through four or five vacuum valve globes, the invention
of Sir Oliver Lodge, which permit the current to pass
through them in one direction only. This is necessary
because, as we saw in <a href="#chapter_VIII" class="pginternal">Chapter VIII</a>., two opposite currents
are induced in the secondary winding of the coil, one at the
make and the other at the break of the primary circuit.
Although the condenser fitted in the base of the coil
suppresses to a great extent the current induced on making
the circuit, still the current from the coil is not quite
uni-directional, but it is made so by the vacuum rectifying
valves. These are arranged to pass only the positive
current, and this current is led to overhead wires out in the
field to be electrified. Lemström used wires at a height of
18 inches from the ground, but these were very much in
the way, and in the Lodge-Newman system the main wires
are carried on large porcelain insulators fixed at the top of
poles at a height of about 15 feet. This arrangement
allows carting and all other agricultural operations to be
carried on as usual. The poles are set round the field,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
about one to the acre, and from these main wires finer
ones are carried across the field. These wires are placed
about 30 feet apart, so that the whole field is covered by a
network of wires. The electricity supplied to the wires is
at a pressure of about 100,000 volts, and this is constantly
being discharged into the air above the plants. It then
passes through the plants, and so reaches the earth. This
system may be applied also to plants growing in greenhouses,
but owing to the confined space, and to the amount
of metal about, in the shape of hot-water pipes and wires
for supporting plants such as vines and cucumbers, it is
difficult to make satisfactory arrangements to produce the
discharge.</p>

<p>The results obtained with this apparatus at Evesham,
in Gloucestershire, by Mr. Newman, have been most
striking. With wheat, increases of from 20 per cent. to
nearly 40 per cent. have been obtained, and the electrified
wheat is of better quality than unelectrified wheat grown at
the same place, and, apart from electrification, under exactly
the same conditions. In some instances the electrified
wheat was as much as 8 inches higher than the
unelectrified wheat. Mr. Newman believes that by
electrification land yielding normally from 30 to 40 bushels
of wheat per acre can be made to yield 50 or even 60
bushels per acre. With cucumbers under glass increases
of 17 per cent. have been obtained, and in the case of
strawberries, increases of 36 per cent. with old plants, and
80 per cent. with one-year-old plants. In almost every
case electrification has produced a marked increase in the
crop, and in the few cases where there has been a decrease
the crops were ready earlier than the normal. For instance,
in one experiment with broad beans a decrease of 15 per
cent. resulted, but the beans were ready for picking five
days earlier. In another case a decrease of 11½ per cent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
occurred with strawberries, but the fruit was ready for
picking some days before the unelectrified fruit, and also
was much sweeter. In some of the experiments resulting
in a decrease in the yield it is probable that the electrification
was overdone, so that the plants were over-stimulated.
It seems likely that the best results will be obtained only
by adjusting the intensity and the duration of the electrification
in accordance with the atmospheric conditions, and
also with the nature of the crop, for there is no doubt that
plants vary considerably in their electrical requirements.
A great deal more experiment is required however to
enable this to be done with anything like certainty.</p>

<p>Unlike the farmer, the market gardener has to produce
one crop after another throughout the year. To make up
for the absence of sufficient sunshine he has to resort to
“forcing” in many cases, but unfortunately this process,
besides being costly, generally results in the production of
a crop of inferior quality. Evidently the work of the
market gardener would be greatly facilitated by some
artificial substitute for sunshine, to keep his plants growing
properly in dull weather. In 1880, Sir William Siemens,
knowing that the composition of the light of the electric
arc was closely similar to that of sunlight, commenced
experiments with an arc lamp in a large greenhouse. His
idea was to add to the effects of the solar light by using
the arc lamp throughout the night. His first efforts were
unsuccessful, and he discovered that this was due to the
use of the naked light, which apparently contained rays
too powerful for the plants. He then passed the light
through glass, which filtered out the more powerful rays,
and this arrangement was most successful, the plants
responding readily to the artificial light. More scientifically
planned experiments were carried out at the London
Royal Botanic Gardens in 1907, by Mr. B. H. Thwaite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
and these showed that by using the arc lamp for about five
hours every night, a great difference between the treated
plants and other similar plants grown normally could be
produced in less than a month. Other experiments made
in the United States with the arc lamp, and also with
ordinary electric incandescent lamps, gave similar results,
and it was noticed that the improvement was specially
marked with cress, lettuce, spinach, and other plants of this
nature.</p>

<p>In 1910, Miss E. C. Dudgeon, of Dumfries, commenced
a series of experiments with the Cooper-Hewitt mercury
vapour lamp. Two greenhouses were employed, one of
which was fitted with this lamp. Seeds of various plants
were sown in small pots, one pot of each kind being placed
in each house. The temperature and other conditions
were kept as nearly alike as possible in both houses, and
in the experimental house the lamp was kept going for
about five hours every night. In every case the seeds in
the experimental house germinated several days before
those in the other house, and the resulting plants were
healthy and robust. Later experiments carried out by
Miss Dudgeon with plants were equally successful.</p>

<p>From these experiments it appears that the electric arc,
and still more the mercury vapour lamp, are likely to prove
of great value to the market gardener. As compared with
the arc lamp, the mercury vapour lamp has the great
advantage of requiring scarcely any attention, and also it
uses less current. Unlike the products of ordinary forcing
by heat, the plants grown under the influence of the
mercury vapour light are quite sturdy, so that they can be
planted out with scarcely any “hardening off.” The crop
yields too are larger, and of better quality. The wonderful
effects produced by the Cooper-Hewitt lamp are
certainly not due to heat, for this lamp emits few heat rays.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
The results may be due partly to longer hours worked by
the plants, but this does not explain the greater accumulation
of chlorophyll and stronger development of fibre.</p>

<p>Most of us are familiar with the yarn about the poultry
keeper who fitted all his nests with trap-doors, so that when
a hen laid an egg, the trap-door opened under the weight
and allowed the egg to fall through into a box lined with
hay. The hen then looked round, and finding no egg, at
once set to work to lay another. This in turn dropped,
another egg was laid, and so on. It is slightly doubtful
whether the modern hen could be swindled in this bare-faced
manner, but it is certain that she can be deluded into
working overtime. The scheme is absurdly simple.
Electric lamps are fitted in the fowl-house, and at sunset
the light is switched on. The unsuspecting hens, who are
just thinking about retiring for the night, come to the conclusion
that the day is not yet over, and so they continue
to lay. This is not a yarn, but solid fact, and the increase
in the egg yield obtained in this way by different poultry
keepers ranges from 10 per cent. upwards. Indeed, one
poultry expert claims to have obtained an increase of about
40 per cent.</p>

<p>The ease with which a uniform temperature can be
maintained by electric heating has been utilized in incubator
hatching of chickens. By means of a specially designed
electric radiator the incubator is kept at the right temperature
throughout the hatching period. When the chickens
emerge from the eggs they are transferred to another
contrivance called a “brooder,” which also is electrically
heated, the heat being decreased gradually day by day until
the chicks are sturdy enough to do without it. Even at
this stage however the chickens do not always escape
from the clutches of electricity. Some rearers have
adopted the electric light swindle for the youngsters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
switching on the light after the chickens have had a fair
amount of slumber, so that they start feeding again. In
this way the chickens are persuaded to consume more food
in the twenty-four hours, and the resulting gain in weight
is said to be considerable. More interesting than this
scheme is the method of rearing chickens under the
influence of an electric discharge from wires supplied with
high-tension current. Comparative tests show that electrified
chickens have a smaller mortality and a much greater
rate of growth than chickens brought up in the ordinary
way. It even is said that the electrified chickens have
more kindly dispositions than their unelectrified relatives!</p>

<p>Possibly the high-tension discharge may turn out to be
as beneficial to animals as it has been proved to be for
plants, but so far there is little reliable evidence on this
point, owing to lack of experimenters. A test carried out
in the United States with a flock of sheep is worth
mention. The flock was divided into two parts, one-half
being placed in a field under ordinary conditions, and the
other in a field having a system of overhead discharge
wires, similar to those used in the Lodge-Newman system.
The final result was that the electrified sheep produced
more than twice as many lambs as the unelectrified sheep,
and also a much greater weight of wool. If further experiments
confirm this result, the British farmer will do well to
consider the advisability of electrifying his live-stock.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME RECENT APPLICATIONS OF ELECTRICITY—AN ELECTRIC PIPE LOCATOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">One</span> of the great advantages of living in a town is the
abundant supply of gas and water. These necessary
substances are conveyed to us along underground pipes,
and a large town has miles upon miles of such pipes,
extending in all directions and forming a most complex
network. Gas and water companies keep a record of these
pipes, with the object of finding any pipe quickly when the
necessity arises; but in spite of such records pipes are
often lost, especially where the whole face of the neighbourhood
has changed since the pipes were laid. The finding
of a lost pipe by digging is a very troublesome process, and
even when the pipe is known to be close at hand, it is quite
surprising how many attempts are frequently necessary
before it can be located, and its course traced. As may be
imagined, this is an expensive business, and often it has been
found cheaper to lay a new length of pipe than to find the
old one. There is now an electrical method by which pipe
locating is made comparatively simple, and unless it is very
exceptionally deep down, a pipe never need be abandoned
on account of difficulty in tracing it.</p>

<p>The mechanism of an electric pipe locator is not at all
complicated, consisting only of an induction coil with
battery, and a telephone receiver connected to a coil of a
large number of turns of thin copper wire. If a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
section of a pipe is lost, and has to be located, operations
are commenced from some fitting known to be connected
with it, and from some other fitting which may or may not
be connected with the pipe, but which is believed to be so
connected. The induction coil is set working, and its
secondary terminals are connected one to each of these
fittings. If the second fitting is connected with the pipe,
then the whole length of the pipe between these two points
is traversed by the high-frequency current. The searcher,
wearing the head telephone receiver, with the coil hanging
down from it so as to be close to the ground, walks to and
fro over the ground beneath which the pipe must lie.
When he approaches the pipe the current passing through
the latter induces a similar current in the suspended coil,
and this produces a sort of buzzing or humming sound in
the telephone. The nearer he approaches to the pipe the
louder is the humming, and it reaches its maximum when
he is standing directly over the pipe. In this way the
whole course of the pipe can be traced without any digging,
even when the pipe is 15 or 20 feet down. The absence
of any sounds in the receiver indicates that the second
fitting is not on the required pipe line, and other fittings
have to be tried until one on this line is found.</p>

<h3> <span class="smcap">An Electric Iceberg Detector</span></h3>

<p>Amongst the many dangers to which ships crossing the
Atlantic are exposed is that of collision with icebergs.
These are large masses of ice which have become detached
from the mighty ice-fields of the north, and which travel
slowly and majestically southwards, growing smaller and
smaller as they pass into warmer seas. Icebergs give no
warning of their coming, and in foggy weather, which is very
prevalent in the regions where they are encountered, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
are extremely difficult to see until they are at dangerously
close quarters.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to detect the proximity of
icebergs by noting the variations in the temperature of the
water. We naturally should expect the temperature of the
water to become lower as we approach a large berg, and
this is usually the case. On the other hand, it has been
found that in many instances the temperature near an
iceberg is quite as high as, and sometimes higher than the
average temperature of the ocean. For this reason the
temperature test, taken by itself, is not at all reliable. A
much more certain test is that of the salinity or saltness of
the water. Icebergs are formed from fresh water, and as
they gradually melt during their southward journey the
fresh water mixes with the sea water. Consequently the
water around an iceberg is less salt than the water of the
open ocean. The saltness of water may be determined by
taking its specific gravity, or by various chemical processes;
but while these tests are quite satisfactory when performed
under laboratory conditions, they cannot be carried out at sea
with any approach to accuracy. There is however an electrical
test which can be applied accurately and continuously.
The electrical conducting power of water varies greatly with
the proportion of salt present. If the conductivity of normal
Atlantic water be taken as 1000, then the conductivity of
Thames water is 8, and that of distilled water about 1/22.
The difference in conductivity between normal ocean water
and water in the vicinity of an iceberg is therefore very great.</p>

<p class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>—Diagram of Heat-compensated Salinometer.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The apparatus for detecting differences in salinity by
measuring the conductivity of the water is called a “salinometer,”
and its most perfect form, known as the heat-compensated
conductivity salinometer, is due to Dr. Myer
Coplans. <a href="#fig_43" class="pginternal">Fig. 43</a> shows a diagram of this interesting
piece of apparatus, which is most ingeniously devised. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
insulated electrodes of copper, with platinum points, are
suspended in a <span class="sans bold">U</span>-tube through which the sea water passes
continuously, as indicated in the diagram. A steady current
is passed through the column of water between the two
platinum points, and the conductivity of this column is
measured continuously by very accurate instruments.
Variations in the conductivity, indicating corresponding
variations in the saltness of the water, are thus shown
immediately; but before these indications can be relied
upon the instrument must be compensated for temperature,
because the conductivity of the water increases with a rise,
and decreases with a fall in temperature. This compensation
is effected by the compound bars of brass and steel
shown in the vessel at the right of the figure. These bars
are connected with the wheel and disc from which the
electrodes are suspended. When the temperature of the
water rises, the bars contract, and exert a pull upon the
wheel and disc, so that the electrodes are raised slightly in
the <span class="sans bold">U</span>-tube. This increases the length of the column of
water between the platinum points, and so increases the
resistance, or, what amounts to the same thing, lowers the
conductivity, in exact proportion to the rise in temperature.
Similarly, a fall in temperature lowers the electrodes, and
decreases the resistance by shortening the column of water.
In this way the conductivity of the water remains constant
so far as temperature is concerned, and it varies only with
the saltness of the water. Under ordinary conditions a
considerable decrease in the salinity of the water indicates
the existence of ice in the near neighbourhood, but the
geographical position of the ship has to be taken into
account. Rivers such as the St. Lawrence pour vast
quantities of fresh water into the ocean, and the resulting
decrease in the saltness of the water within a considerable
radius of the mouth of the river must be allowed for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<h3> <span class="smcap">A “Flying Train”</span></h3>

<p>Considerable interest was aroused last year by a model
of a railway working upon a very remarkable system. This
was the invention of Mr. Emile Bachelet, and the model
was brought to London from the United States. The main
principle upon which the system is based is interesting.
About 1884, Professor Elihu Thompson, a famous American
scientist, made the discovery that a plate of copper could be
attracted or repelled by an electro-magnet. The effects
took place at the moment when the magnetism was varied
by suddenly switching the current on or off; the copper
being repelled when the current was switched on, and
attracted when it was switched off. Copper is a non-magnetic
substance, and the attraction and repulsion are
not ordinary magnetic effects, but are due to currents
induced in the copper plate at the instant of producing or
destroying the magnetism. The plate is attracted or
repelled according to whether these induced currents flow in
the same direction as, or in the opposite direction to, the
current in the magnet coil. Brass and aluminium plates
act in the same way as the copper plate, and the effects are
produced equally well by exciting the magnet with alternating
current, which, by changing its direction, changes the
magnetism also. Of the two effects, the repulsion is
much the stronger, especially if the variations in the
magnetism take place very rapidly; and if a powerful
and rapidly alternating current is used, the plate is repelled
so strongly that it remains supported in mid-air above the
magnet.</p>

<p>This repulsive effect is utilized in the Bachelet system
(<a href="#plate_XV" class="pginternal">Plate XV</a>.). There are no rails in the ordinary sense, and
the track is made up of a continuous series of electro-magnets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
The car, which is shaped something like a cigar,
has a floor of aluminium, and contains an iron cylinder,
and it runs above the line of magnets. Along each side
of the track is a channel guide rail, and underneath the car
at each end are fixed two brushes with guide pieces, which
run in the guide rails. Above the car is a third guide rail,
and two brushes with guide pieces fixed on the top of the
car, one at each end, run in this overhead rail. These
guide rails keep the car in position, and also act as conductors
for the current. The repulsive action of the
electro-magnets upon the aluminium floor raises the car
clear of the track, and keeps it suspended; and while
remaining in this mid-air position it is driven, or rather
pulled forward, by powerful solenoids, which are supplied
with continuous current. We have referred previously to
the way in which a solenoid draws into it a core of iron.
When the car enters a solenoid, the latter exerts a pulling
influence upon the iron cylinder inside the car, and so the
car is given a forward movement. This is sufficient to
carry it along to the next solenoid, which gives it another
pull, and so the car is drawn forward from one solenoid
to another to the end of the line. The model referred
to has only a short track of about 30 feet, with one
solenoid at each end; but its working shows that the
pulling power of the solenoids is sufficient to propel the
car.</p>

<p>To avoid the necessity of keeping the whole of the
electro-magnets energized all the time, these are arranged
in sections, which are energized separately. By means of
the lower set of brushes working in the track guides, each
of these sections has alternating current supplied to it as
the car approaches, and switched off from it when the car
has passed. The brushes working in the overhead guide
supply continuous current to each solenoid as the car enters
it, and switch off the current when the car has passed
through. The speed at which the model car travels is
quite extraordinary, and the inventor believes that in actual
practice speeds of more than 300 miles an hour are attainable
on his system.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELECTRICITY IN WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">One</span> of the most striking features of modern naval warfare
is the absolute revolution in methods of communication
brought about by wireless telegraphy. To-day every
warship has its wireless installation. Our cruiser squadrons
and destroyer flotillas, ceaselessly patrolling the waters of
the North Sea, are always in touch with the Admiral of
the Fleet, and with the Admiralty at Whitehall. In the
Atlantic, and in the Pacific too, our cruisers, whether
engaged in hunting down the marauding cruisers of the
enemy or in searching for merchant ships laden with contraband,
have their comings and goings directed by wireless.
Even before the actual declaration of war between
Great Britain and Germany wireless telegraphy began its
work. At the conclusion of the great naval review of
July 1914, the Fleet left Portland to disperse as customary
for manœuvre leave, but a wireless message was dispatched
ordering the Fleet not to disperse. As no state of war
then existed, this was a precautionary measure, but subsequent
events quickly proved how urgently necessary it
had been to keep the Fleet in battle array. Immediately
war was declared Great Britain was able to put into the
North Sea a fleet which hopelessly outnumbered and outclassed
the German battle fleet.</p>

<p>At the outset Germany had a number of cruisers in the
Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Owing to the vigilance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of our warships these vessels were unable to join the
German Home Fleet, and they immediately adopted the
rôle of commerce destroyers. In this work they made
extensive use of wireless telegraphy to ascertain the whereabouts
of British merchant ships, and for a short time they
played quite a merry game. Prominent among these
raiders was the <i>Emden</i>. It was really astonishing how
this cruiser obtained information regarding the sailings of
British ships. It is said that on one occasion she called up
by wireless a merchant ship, and inquired if the latter had
seen anything of a German cruiser. The unsuspecting
merchantman replied that there was no such thing as a
German warship in the vicinity. “Oh yes, there is,”
returned the <i>Emden</i>; “I’m it!” and shortly afterwards she
appeared on the horizon, to the great discomfiture of the
British skipper. An interesting account of the escape of a
British liner from another notorious raider, the <i>Karlsruhe</i>,
has been given in the <cite>Nautical Magazine</cite>. The writer
says:</p>

<p>“I have just returned home after a voyage to South
America in one of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company’s
cargo boats. When we left Montevideo we heard that
France and Germany were at war, and that there was
every possibility of Great Britain sending an ultimatum to
Germany. We saw several steamers after leaving the
port, but could get no information, as few of them were
fitted with wireless and passed at some distance off. When
about 200 miles east of Rio, our wireless operator overheard
some conversation between the German cruiser
<i>Karlsruhe</i> and a German merchant ship at anchor in Rio.
It was clearly evident that the German merchant ship had
no special code, as the conversation was carried on in plain
German language, and our operator, who, by the way, was
master of several languages, was able to interpret these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
messages without the slightest difficulty. It was then that
we learned that Great Britain was at war. The German
cruiser was inquiring from the German merchant ship what
British vessels were leaving Rio, and asking for any information
which might be of use. We also picked up some
news of German victories in Belgium, which were given
out by the German merchant ship. It was clearly evident
that the <i>Karlsruhe</i> had information about our ship, and
expected us to be in the position she anticipated, for she
sent out a signal to us in English, asking us for our latitude
and longitude. This our operator, under the instructions
of the captain, declined to give. The German operator
evidently got furious, as he called us an English ‘swine-hound,’
and said, ‘This is a German warship, <i>Karlsruhe</i>;
we will you find.’ Undoubtedly he thought he was going
to strike terror to our hearts, but he made a mistake.</p>

<p>“That night we steamed along without lights, and we
knew from the sound of the wireless signals that were
being flashed out from the German ship that we were
getting nearer and nearer to her. Fortunately for us,
about midnight a thick misty rain set in and we passed the
German steamer, and so escaped. Our operator said that
we could not have been more than 8 or 10 miles away
when we passed abeam. Undoubtedly our wireless on
this occasion saved us from the danger from which we
escaped.”</p>

<p>Apparently little is known of the end of the <i>Karlsruhe</i>,
but the <i>Emden</i> met with the fate she richly deserved; and
fittingly enough, wireless telegraphy, which had enabled
her to carry out her marauding exploits, was the means of
bringing her to her doom. On 9th November 1914 the
<i>Emden</i> anchored off the Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group
of coral islets in the Indian Ocean, and landed a party of
three officers and forty men to cut the cable and destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the wireless station. Before the Germans could get to the
station, a wireless message was sent out stating the
presence of the enemy warship, and this call was received
by the Australian cruisers <i>Melbourne</i> and <i>Sydney</i>. These
vessels, which were then only some 50 miles away, were
engaged, along with a Japanese cruiser, in escorting transports.
The <i>Sydney</i> at once went off at full speed, caught
the <i>Emden</i>, and sent her to the bottom after a short but
sharp engagement. As the <i>Emden</i> fled at sight of the
Australian warship, the landing party had not time to get
aboard, and consequently were left behind. They seized
an old schooner, provisioned her, and set sail, but what
became of them is not known.</p>

<p>In land warfare field telegraphs play a very important
part; indeed it is certain that without them the vast military
operations of the present war could not be carried on.
The General Headquarters of our army in France is in
telegraphic communication not only with neighbouring
French towns, but also with Paris and London. From
Headquarters also run wires to every point of the firing-line,
so that the Headquarters Staff, and through them the
War Office in London, know exactly what is taking place
along the whole front. The following extract from a letter
from an officer, published by <cite>The Times</cite>, gives a remarkably
good idea of the work of the signal companies of the
Royal Engineers.</p>

<p>“As the tide of battle turns this way and the other, and
headquarters are constantly moving, some means have to be
provided to keep in constant touch with General Headquarters
during the movement. This emergency is met
by cable detachments. Each detachment consists of two
cable waggons, which usually work in conjunction with one
another, one section laying the line whilst the other remains
behind to reel up when the line is finished with. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
division is ordered to move quickly to a more tactical
position. The end of the cable is connected with the
permanent line, which communicates to Army Headquarters,
and the cable detachment moves off at the trot; across
country, along roads, through villages, and past columns of
troops, the white and blue badge of the signal service
clears the way. Behind the waggon rides a horseman, who
deftly lays the cable in the ditches and hedges out of danger
from heavy transport and the feet of tramping infantry,
with the aid of a crookstick. Other horsemen are in the
rear tying back and making the line safe. On the box of
the waggon sits a telegraphist, who is constantly in touch
with headquarters as the cable runs swiftly out. An
orderly dashes up with an important message; the waggon
is stopped, the message dispatched, and on they go again.”</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy too has its part to play in land
war, and for field purposes it has certain advantages over
telegraphy with wires. Ordinary telegraphic communication
is liable to be interrupted by the cutting of the wire by
the enemy, or, in spite of every care in laying, by the
breaking of the wire by passing cavalry or artillery. No
such trouble can occur with wireless telegraphy, and if it
becomes necessary to move a wireless station with great
rapidity, as for instance on an unexpected advance of the
enemy, it is an advantage to have no wire to bother about.
The Marconi portable wireless sets for military purposes
are marvels of compactness and lightness, combined with
simplicity. They are of two kinds, pack-saddle sets and
cart sets. The former weigh about 360 lb., this being
divided amongst four horses. They can be set up in ten
minutes by five or six men, and require only two men to
work them. Their guaranteed range is 40 miles, but
they are capable of transmitting twice this distance or even
more under favourable conditions. The cart sets can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
set up in twenty minutes by seven or eight men, and they
have a guaranteed range of from 150 to 200 miles.</p>

<p>It is obviously very important that wireless military
messages should not be intercepted and read by the enemy,
and the method of avoiding danger of this kind adopted
with the Marconi field stations is ingenious and effective.
The transmitter and the receiver are arranged to work on
three different fixed wave-lengths, the change from one to
another being effected quickly by the movement of a three-position
switch. By this means the transmitting operator
sends three or four words on one wave-length, then changes
to another, transmits a few words on this, changes the wave-length
again, and so on. Each change is accompanied by
the sending of a code letter which informs the receiving
operator to which wave-length the transmitter is passing.
The receiving operator adjusts his switch accordingly, and
so he hears the whole message without interruption, the
change from one wave-length to another taking only a small
fraction of a second. An enemy operator might manage
to adjust his wave-length so as to hear two or three words,
but the sudden change of wave-length would throw him out
of tune, and by the time he had found the new wave-length
this would have changed again. Thus he would hear at
most only a few disconnected words at intervals, and he
would not be able to make head or tail of the message.
To provide against the possibility of the three wave-lengths
being measured and prepared for, these fixed lengths themselves
can be changed, if necessary, many times a day, so
that the enemy operators would never know beforehand
which three were to be used.</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy was systematically employed in
land warfare for the first time in the Balkan War, during
which it proved most useful both to the Allies and to the
Turks. One of the most interesting features of the war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
was the way in which wireless communication was kept up
between the beleaguered city of Adrianople and the
Turkish capital. Some time before war broke out the
Turkish Government sent a portable Marconi wireless set
to Adrianople, and this was set up at a little distance from
the city. When war was declared the apparatus was
brought inside the city walls and erected upon a small hill.
Then came the siege. For 153 days Shukri Pasha kept
the Turkish flag flying, but the stubborn defence was
broken down in the end through hunger and disease. All
through these weary days the little wireless set did its duty
unfalteringly, and by its aid regular communication was
maintained with the Government station at Ok Meidan,
just outside Constantinople, 130 miles away. Altogether
about half a million words were transmitted from Adrianople
to the Turkish capital.</p>

<p class="floatc">(<i>b</i>) AEROPLANE FITTED WITH WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>The rapid development of aviation during the past few
years has drawn attention to the necessity for some means
of communication between the land and airships and
aeroplanes in flight. At first sight it might appear that
wireless telegraphy could be used for this purpose without
any trouble, but experience has shown that there are
certain difficulties in the way, especially with regard to
aeroplanes. The chief difficulty with aeroplanes lies in the
aerial. This must take the form either of a long trailing
wire or of fixed wires running between the planes and the
tail. A trailing wire is open to the objection that it is
liable to get mixed up with the propeller, besides which it
appears likely to hamper to some slight extent the movements
of a small and light machine. A fixed aerial between
planes and tail avoids these difficulties, but on the other
hand its wave-length is bound to be inconveniently small.
The heavy and powerful British military aeroplanes
apparently use a trailing wire of moderate length, carried
in a special manner so as to clear the propeller, but few
details are available at present. A further trouble with
aeroplanes lies in the tremendous noise made by the
engine, which frequently makes it quite impossible to hear
incoming signals; and the only way of getting over this
difficulty appears to be for the operator to wear some sort
of sound-proof head-gear. Signals have been transmitted
from an aeroplane in flight up to distances of 40 or 50 miles
quite successfully, but the reception of signals by aeroplanes
is not so satisfactory, except for comparatively short distances.
Although few particulars have been published
regarding the work of the British aeroplanes in France, it
seems evident that wireless telegraphy is in regular use.
In addition to their value as scouts, our aeroplanes appear
to be extremely useful for the direction of heavy artillery
fire, using wireless to tell the gunners where each shell falls,
until the exact range is obtained. In the case of airships
the problem of wireless communication is much simpler.
A trailing wire presents no difficulties, and on account of
their great size much more powerful sets of apparatus can
be carried. The huge German Zeppelin airships have a
long freely-floating aerial consisting of a wire which can be
wound in or let out as required, its full length being about
750 feet. The total weight of the apparatus is nearly
300 lb., and the transmitting range is said to be from
about 120 to 200 miles.</p>

<p>Electricity is used in the navy for a great variety of
purposes besides telegraphy. Our battleships are lighted
by electricity, which is generated at a standard pressure of
220 volts. This current is transformed down for the
searchlights, and also for the intricate systems of telephone,
alarm, and firing circuits. The magazines containing the
deadly cordite are maintained at a constant temperature of
70° F. by special refrigerating machinery driven by electricity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
and the numerous fans for ventilating the different parts of
the ship are also electrically driven. Electric power is used
for capstans, coaling winches, sounding machines, lifts,
pumps, whether for drainage, fire extinction, or raising
fresh water from the tanks, and for the mechanism for
operating boats and torpedo nets. The mechanism for
manipulating the great guns and their ammunition is
hydraulic. Electricity was tried for this purpose on the
battle cruiser <i>Invincible</i>, but was abandoned in favour of
hydraulic power. But though electricity is apparently out of
favour in this department, it takes an extremely important
share in the work of controlling and firing the guns; its duties
being such as could not be carried out by hydraulic power.</p>

<p>The guns are controlled and fired from what is known
as the fire-control room, which is situated in the interior of
the ship, quite away from the guns themselves. The
range-finder, from his perch up in the gigantic mast,
watches an enemy warship as she looms on the horizon,
and when she comes within range he estimates her distance
by means of instruments of wonderful precision. He then
telephones to the fire-control room, giving this distance,
and also the enemy’s speed and course. The officer in
charge of the fire-control room calculates the elevation of
the gun required for this distance, and decides upon the
instant at which the gun must be fired. A telephoned
order goes to the gun-turret, and the guns are brought to
bear upon the enemy, laid at the required elevation, and
sighted. At the correct instant the fire-control officer
switches on an electric current to the gun, which fires a
small quantity of highly explosive material, and this in
turn fires the main charge of cordite. The effect of the
shell is watched intently from the fire-control top, up above
the range-finder, and if, as is very likely, this first shell
falls short of, or overshoots the mark, an estimate of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
amount of error is communicated to the fire-control room.
Due corrections are then made, the gun is laid at a slightly
different elevation, and this time the shell finds its mark
with unerring accuracy.</p>

<p>The range of movement, horizontal and vertical, of
modern naval guns is so great that it is possible for two
guns to be in such relative positions that the firing of one
would damage the other. To guard against a disaster of
this kind fixed stops are used, supplemented by ingenious
automatic alarms. The alarm begins to sound as soon as
any gun passes into a position in which it could damage
another gun, and it goes on sounding until the latter gun
is moved out of the danger line.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war the subject of submarine
mines has been brought to our notice in very forcible
fashion. Contrary to the general impression, the explosive
submarine mine is not a recent introduction. It is difficult
to say exactly when mines were first brought into use, but
at any rate we know that they were employed by Russia
during the Crimean War, apparently with little success.
The first really successful use of mines occurred in the
American Civil War, when the Confederates sank a number
of vessels by means of them. This practical demonstration
of their possibilities did not pass unnoticed by European
nations, and in the Franco-German War we find that mines
were used for harbour defence by both belligerents. It is
doubtful whether either nation derived much benefit from
its mines, and indeed as the war progressed Germany
found that the principal result of her mining operations was
to render her harbours difficult and dangerous to her own
shipping. Much greater success attended the use of mines
in the Russo-Japanese War, but all previous records shrink
into insignificance when compared with the destruction
wrought by mines in the present great conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>Submarine mines may be divided into two classes;
those for harbour defence, and those for use in the open
sea. Harbour defence mines are almost invariably electrically
controlled; that is, they are connected with the shore
by means of a cable, and fired by an electric impulse sent
along that cable. In one system of control the moment of
firing is determined entirely by observers on shore, who,
aided by special optical instruments, are able to tell exactly
when a vessel is above any particular mine. The actual
firing is carried out by depressing a key which completes
an electric circuit, thus sending a current along the cable
to actuate the exploding mechanism inside the mine. A
hostile ship therefore would be blown up on arriving at the
critical position, while a friendly vessel would be allowed
to pass on in safety. In this system of control there is no
contact between the vessel and the mine, the latter being
well submerged or resting on the sea floor, so that the
harbour is not obstructed in any way. This is a great
advantage, but against it must be set possible failure of the
defence at a critical moment owing to thick weather, which
of course interferes seriously with the careful observation
of the mine field necessary for accurate timing of the explosions.
This difficulty may be surmounted by a contact
system of firing. In this case the mines are placed so near
the surface as to make contact with vessels passing over
them. The observers on shore are informed of the contact
by means of an electric impulse automatically transmitted
along the cable, so that they are independent of continuous
visual observation of the mined area. As in the previous
system, the observers give the actual firing impulse. The
drawback to this method is the necessity for special pilotage
arrangements for friendly ships in order to avoid unnecessary
striking of the mines, which are liable to have their
mechanism deranged by constant blows. If the harbour or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
channel can be closed entirely to friendly shipping, the
observers may be dispensed with, their place being taken
by automatic electric apparatus which fires at once any mine
struck by a vessel.</p>

<p>Shore-controlled mines are excellent for harbour
defence, and a carefully distributed mine-field, backed by
heavy fort guns, presents to hostile vessels a barrier which
may be regarded as almost impenetrable. A strong fleet
might conceivably force its way through, but in so doing it
would sustain tremendous losses; and as these losses would
be quite out of proportion to any probable gains, such an
attempt is not likely to be made except as a last resort.</p>

<p>For use in the open sea a different type of mine is
required. This must be quite self-contained and automatic
in action, exploding when struck by a passing vessel. The
exploding mechanism may take different forms. The blow
given by a ship may be made to withdraw a pin, thus
releasing a sort of plunger, which, actuated by a powerful
spring, detonates the charge. A similar result is obtained
by the use of a suspended weight, in place of plunger and
spring. Still another form of mine is fired electrically by
means of a battery, the circuit of which is closed automatically
by the percussion. Deep-sea mines may be anchored
or floating free. Free mines are particularly dangerous on
account of the impossibility of knowing where they may be
at any given moment. They are liable to drift for considerable
distances, and to pass into neutral seas; and to
safeguard neutral shipping international rules require them
to have some sort of clockwork mechanism which renders
them harmless after a period of one hour. It is quite
certain that some, at least, of the German free mines have
no such mechanism, so that neutral shipping is greatly
endangered.</p>

<p>Submarine mines are known as <em>ground</em> mines, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
<em>buoyant</em> mines, according to whether they rest on the sea
bottom or float below the surface. Ground mines are
generally made in the form of a cylinder, buoyant mines
being usually spherical. The cases are made of steel, and
buoyancy is given when required by enclosing air spaces.
Open-sea mines are laid by special vessels, mostly old
cruisers. The stern of these ships is partly cut away, and
the mines are run along rails to the stern, and so overboard.
The explosive employed is generally gun-cotton, fired by
a detonator, charges up to 500 lb. or more being used,
according to the depth of submersion and the horizontal
distance at which the mine is desired to be effective.
Ground mines can be used only in shallow water, and even
then they require a heavier charge than mines floating near
the surface. Mines must not be laid too close together, as
the explosion of one might damage others. The distance
apart at which they are placed depends upon the amount
of charge, 500-lb. mines requiring to be about 300 feet apart
for safety.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> question which heads this, our final chapter, is one
which must occur to every one who takes even the most
casual interest in matters scientific, and it would be very
satisfactory if we could bring this volume to a conclusion
by providing a full and complete answer. Unfortunately
this is impossible. In years to come the tireless labours of
scientific investigators may lead to a solution of the problem;
but, as Professor Fleming puts it: “The question—What
is electricity?—no more admits of a complete and final
answer to-day than does the question—What is life?”</p>

<p>From the earliest days of electrical science theories of
electricity have been put forward. The gradual extension
and development of these theories, and the constant substitution
of one idea for another as experimental data
increased, provide a fascinating subject for study. To
cover this ground however, even in outline, would necessitate
many chapters, and so it will be better to consider
only the theory which, with certain reservations in some
cases, is held by the scientific world of to-day. This is
known as the <em>electron</em> theory of electricity.</p>

<p>We have referred already, in <a href="#chapter_XXIV" class="pginternal">Chapter XXIV</a>., to atoms
and electrons. All matter is believed to be constituted
of minute particles called “atoms.” These atoms are so
extremely small that they are quite invisible, being far
beyond the range of the most powerful microscope; and
their diameter has been estimated at somewhere about one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
millionth of a millimetre. Up to a few years ago the atom
was believed to be quite indivisible, but it has been proved
beyond doubt that this is not the case. An atom may be
said to consist of two parts, one much larger than the
other. The smaller part is negatively electrified, and is
the same in all atoms; while the larger part is positively
electrified, and varies according to the nature of the atom.
The small negatively electrified portion of the atom consists of
particles called “electrons,” and these electrons are believed
to be indivisible units or atoms of negative electricity. To
quote Professor Fleming: “An atom of matter in its neutral
condition has been assumed to consist of an outer shell or
envelope of negative electrons associated with some core or
matrix which has an opposite electrical quality, such that if
an electron is withdrawn from the atom the latter is left
positively electrified.”</p>

<p>The electrons in an atom are not fixed, but move with
great velocity, in definite orbits. They repel one another,
and are constantly endeavouring to fly away from the atom,
but they are held in by the attraction of the positive core.
So long as nothing occurs to upset the constitution of the
atom, a state of equilibrium is maintained and the atom is
electrically neutral; but immediately the atom is broken up
by the action of an external force of some kind, one or
more electrons break their bonds and fly away to join some
other atom. An atom which has lost some of its electrons
is no longer neutral, but is electro-positive; and similarly,
an atom which has gained additional electrons is electro-negative.
Electrons, or atoms of negative electricity, can
be isolated from atoms of matter, as in the case of the
stream of electrons proceeding from the cathode of a vacuum
tube. So far, however, it has been found impossible to
isolate corresponding atoms of positive electricity.</p>

<p>From these facts it appears that we must regard a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
positively charged body as possessing a deficiency of
electrons, and a negatively charged body as possessing an
excess of electrons. In <a href="#chapter_I" class="pginternal">Chapter I</a>. we spoke of the
electrification of sealing-wax or glass rods by friction, and
we saw that according to the nature of the substance used
as the rubber, the rods were either positively or negatively
electrified. Apparently, when we rub a glass rod with a
piece of silk, the surface atoms of each substance are
disturbed, and a certain number of electrons leave the glass
atoms, and join the silk atoms. The surface atoms of the
glass, previously neutral, are now electro-positive through
the loss of electrons; and the surface atoms of the silk,
also previously neutral, are now electro-negative through
the additional electrons received from the glass atoms.
As the result we find the glass to be positively, and silk to
be negatively electrified. On the other hand, if we rub the
glass with fur, a similar atomic disturbance and consequent
migration of electrons takes place, but this time the glass
receives electrons instead of parting with them. In this case
the glass becomes negatively, and the fur positively electrified.
The question now arises, why is the movement of the electrons
away from the glass in the first instance, and toward it in
the second? To understand this we may make use of a
simple analogy. If we place in contact two bodies, one hot
and the other cold, the hot body gives up some of its heat
to the cold body; but if we place in contact with the hot
body another body which is still hotter, then the hot body
receives heat instead of parting with it. In a somewhat
similar manner an atom is able to give some of its electrons
to another atom which, in comparison with it, is deficient in
electrons; and at the same time it is able to receive electrons
from another atom which, compared with it, has an
excess of electrons. Thus we may assume that the glass
atoms have an excess of electrons as compared with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
silk atoms, and a deficiency in electrons as compared with
fur atoms.</p>

<p>A current of electricity is believed to be nothing more
or less than a stream of electrons, set in motion by the
application of an electro-motive force. We have seen that
some substances are good conductors of electricity, while
others are bad conductors or non-conductors. In order to
produce an electric current, that is a current of electrons, it
is evidently necessary that the electrons should be free to
move. In good conductors, which are mostly metals, it is
believed that the electrons are able to move from atom to
atom without much hindrance, while in a non-conductor
their movements are hampered to such an extent that inter-atomic
exchange of electrons is almost impossible. Speaking on
this point, Professor Fleming says: “There may be (in
a good conductor) a constant decomposition and recomposition
of atoms taking place, and any given electron so to
speak flits about, now forming part of one atom and now of
another, and anon enjoying a free existence. It resembles
a person visiting from house to house, forming a unit in
different households, and, in between, being a solitary
person in the street. In non-conductors, on the other hand,
the electrons are much restricted in their movements, and
can be displaced a little way but are pulled back again
when released.”</p>

<p>Let us try to see now how an electric current is set up
in a simple voltaic cell, consisting of a zinc plate and a
copper plate immersed in dilute acid. First we must
understand the meaning of the word <em>ion</em>. If we place a
small quantity of salt in a vessel containing water, the salt
dissolves, and the water becomes salt, not only at the
bottom where the salt was placed, but throughout the
whole vessel. This means that the particles of salt must be
able to move through the water. Salt is a chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
compound of sodium and chlorine, and its molecules
consist of atoms of both these substances. It is supposed
that each salt molecule breaks up into two parts, one part
being a sodium atom, and the other a chlorine atom; and
further, that the sodium atom loses an electron, while the
chlorine atom gains one. These atoms have the power of
travelling about through the solution, and they are called
<em>ions</em>, which means “wanderers.” An ordinary atom is unable
to wander about in this way, but it gains travelling power
as soon as it is converted into an ion, by losing electrons if
it be an atom of a metal, and by gaining electrons if it be
an atom of a non-metal.</p>

<p>Returning to the voltaic cell, we may imagine that the
atoms of the zinc which are immersed in the acid are trying
to turn themselves into ions, so that they can travel through
the solution. In order to do this each atom parts with two
electrons, and these electrons try to attach themselves to
the next atom. This atom however already has two
electrons, and so in order to accept the newcomers it must
pass on its own two. In this way electrons are passed on
from atom to atom of the zinc, then along the connecting
wire, and so to the copper plate. The atoms of zinc which
have lost their electrons thus become ions, with power of
movement. They leave the zinc plate immediately, and so
the plate wastes away or dissolves. So we get a constant
stream of electrons travelling along the wire connecting the
two plates, and this constitutes an electric current.</p>

<p>The electron theory gives us also a clear conception of
magnetism. An electric current flowing along a wire
produces magnetic effects; that is, it sets up a field of
magnetic force. Such a current is a stream of electrons,
and therefore we conclude that a magnetic field is produced
by electrons in motion. This being so, we are led to
suppose that there must be a stream of electrons in a steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
magnet, and this stream must be constant because the
magnetic field of such a magnet is permanent. The
electron stream in a permanent magnet however is not
quite the same as the electron stream in a wire conveying a
current. We have stated that the electrons constituting an
atom move in definite orbits, so that we may picture them
travelling round the core of the atom as the planets travel
round the Sun. This movement is continuous in every
atom of every substance. Apparently we have here the
necessary conditions for the production of a magnetic field,
that is, a constant stream of electrons; but one important
thing is still lacking. In an unmagnetized piece of steel the
atoms are not arranged symmetrically, so that the orbits of
their electrons lie some in one plane and some in another.
Consequently, although the electron stream of each atom
undoubtedly produces an infinitesimally small magnetic
field, no magnetic effect that we can detect is produced,
because the different streams are not working in unison and
adding together their forces. In fact they are upsetting
and neutralizing each other’s efforts. By stroking the piece
of steel with a magnet, or by surrounding it by a coil of
wire conveying a current, the atoms are turned so that their
electron orbits all lie in the same plane. The electron
streams now all work in unison, their magnetic effects are
added together, and we get a strong magnetic field as the
result of their combined efforts. Any piece of steel or iron
may be regarded as a potential magnet, requiring only a
rearrangement of its atoms in order to become an active
magnet. In <a href="#chapter_VI" class="pginternal">Chapter VI</a>. it was stated that other substances
besides iron and steel show magnetic effects, and this is what
we should expect, as the electron movement is common to
all atoms. None of these substances is equal to iron
and steel in magnetic power, but why this is so is not
understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>This brings us to the production of an electric current by
the dynamo. Here we have a coil of wire moving across a
magnetic field, alternately passing into this field and out of
it. A magnetic field is produced, as we have just seen, by
the steady movement of electrons, and we may picture it
as being a region of the ether disturbed or strained by the
effect of the moving electrons. When the coil of wire
passes into the magnetic field, the electrons of its atoms are
influenced powerfully and set in motion in one direction, so
producing a current in the coil. As the coil passes away
from the field, its electrons receive a second impetus, which
checks their movement and starts them travelling in the
opposite direction, and another current is produced. The
coil moves continuously and regularly, passing into and out
of the magnetic field without interruption; and so we get a
current which reverses its direction at regular intervals, that
is, an alternating current. This current may be made continuous
if desired, as explained in <a href="#chapter_IX" class="pginternal">Chapter IX</a>.</p>

<p>Such, stated briefly and in outline, is the electron theory
of electricity. It opens up possibilities of the most fascinating
nature; it gives us a wonderfully clear conception of
what might be called the inner mechanism of electricity; and
it even introduces us to the very atoms of electricity.
Beyond this, at present, it cannot take us, and the actual
nature of electricity itself remains an enigma.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
